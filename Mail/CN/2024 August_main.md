Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 August.

### Key Points from the Analysis of Infectious Diseases in Mainland China for August 2024:

The data from August 2024 highlight several infectious diseases that require close monitoring, based on the number of reported cases, associated deaths, and potential public health impact. Below is a summary of the critical infectious diseases:

#### 1. **Tuberculosis (TB)**
   - **Cases**: 84,304
   - **Deaths**: 179
   - **Trend**: TB continues to be a significant concern with high case numbers and deaths. The number of cases remains consistently high, and the fatality rate suggests a continued need for targeted interventions.
   - **Action**: Strengthen TB control programs, with a focus on early diagnosis, treatment adherence, and addressing drug-resistant strains.

#### 2. **Hepatitis (A, B, C, D, E)**
   - **Total Hepatitis Cases**: 132,782 (various types)
   - **Total Hepatitis Deaths**: 56
   - **Notable Types**:
     - **Hepatitis B**: 106,135 cases and 46 deaths
     - **Hepatitis C**: 22,400 cases and 8 deaths
   - **Trend**: Hepatitis B and C are highly prevalent, contributing significantly to the overall burden of liver disease. Mortality remains a concern, particularly for chronic cases progressing to liver failure or cancer.
   - **Action**: Strengthen vaccination programs (for Hepatitis B), improve public awareness, and provide antiviral treatment for chronic cases to reduce complications.

#### 3. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD)**
   - **Cases**: 189,017
   - **Deaths**: 1
   - **Trend**: HFMD is one of the most common diseases, particularly affecting children. Although the fatality rate is low, the sheer volume of cases makes this disease a public health priority.
   - **Action**: Continued monitoring and public health campaigns to reduce transmission in schools and childcare facilities.

#### 4. **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**
   - **Cases**: 6,404
   - **Deaths**: 1,726 (all-cause deaths in AIDS patients)
   - **Trend**: AIDS remains a major concern due to its high mortality rate. The number of deaths is high relative to the number of cases, reflecting the severity of the disease.
   - **Action**: Strengthen antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs and improve care for AIDS patients, especially in preventing opportunistic infections.

#### 5. **Scarlet Fever**
   - **Cases**: 51,616
   - **Deaths**: 8
   - **Trend**: Scarlet fever has a moderately high number of cases with low mortality. However, the large number of cases suggests ongoing outbreaks, particularly in children.
   - **Action**: Monitor outbreaks, improve hygiene practices in schools, and ensure timely treatment with antibiotics.

#### 6. **Dengue**
   - **Cases**: 6,120
   - **Deaths**: 2
   - **Trend**: Dengue has seen a spike in cases, with fatalities reported. This vector-borne disease is seasonal and linked to mosquito activity.
   - **Action**: Intensify vector control measures, especially in regions experiencing a dengue outbreak, and raise public awareness about mosquito bite prevention.

#### 7. **Influenza**
   - **Cases**: 50,665
   - **Deaths**: 1
   - **Trend**: Influenza, though with relatively low fatality rates, continues to result in substantial morbidity.
   - **Action**: Maintain and enhance seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns, especially targeting high-risk populations like the elderly and individuals with pre-existing health conditions.

#### 8. **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**
   - **Cases**: 649
   - **Deaths**: 1
   - **Trend**: While the number of cases is relatively low, epidemic hemorrhagic fever has a higher mortality rate per case.
   - **Action**: Enhance surveillance and response efforts in affected areas, focusing on rodent control to reduce exposure to hantaviruses.

#### 9. **Rabies**
   - **Cases**: 42
   - **Deaths**: 37
   - **Trend**: Rabies continues to be highly fatal once symptoms appear, with almost all cases resulting in death.
   - **Action**: Expand rabies vaccination for domestic animals and post-exposure prophylaxis for humans to reduce incidence.

#### 10. **Japanese Encephalitis**
   - **Cases**: 81
   - **Deaths**: 2
   - **Trend**: Japanese encephalitis has a high mortality rate relative to its low incidence.
   - **Action**: Strengthen vaccination in endemic areas and improve vector control to prevent outbreaks.

### Additional Noteworthy Observations:
- **Infectious Diarrhea** (excluding cholera, dysentery, and typhoid/paratyphoid): 97,658 cases and 1 death. Although the death toll is low, the number of cases is substantial.
- **Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever**: 1,040 cases, no deaths. While the case numbers are relatively low, continued vigilance is necessary to prevent outbreaks, particularly in regions with water sanitation issues.

### Diseases with Lower Case Numbers but Requiring Monitoring:
- **Leprosy**: 53 cases and 1 death.
- **Anthrax**: 66 cases and 1 death.
- **Plague**: 0 cases reported this month, but always a concern given its history of severe outbreaks.

### Conclusion:
Infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, hepatitis, and AIDS continue to pose significant public health challenges in China, requiring robust prevention and treatment strategies. Diseases like dengue and scarlet fever show seasonal and outbreak patterns that need localized interventions. Additionally, rarer but deadly diseases like rabies and epidemic hemorrhagic fever highlight the need for continuous vigilance and rapid response to prevent fatalities.
