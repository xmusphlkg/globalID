Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 May.

In the analysis of monthly cases and deaths related to various diseases in Chinese mainland for the month of 2024 May, here are some key points:

**1. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome:** There were 6404 cases and 1726 deaths reported. It's noticeable that the number of deaths is a significant proportion of the total number of cases, indicating the seriousness of this disease.

**2. Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis:** A total of 4208 cases were reported, with only 1 death. This indicates a high prevalence but low mortality rate for this disease.

**3. Anthrax:** There were 66 cases and 1 death. The numbers are relatively lower compared to other diseases, symbolising a lower incidence and death rate for this month.

**4. Brucellosis:** A high number of cases at 4755 were reported, but with no related deaths. This can be interpreted as a high infection rate but with effective treatment methods.

**5. Dengue:** Significant 3311 cases but no related deaths were reported. This shows a controlled mortality rate despite the high number of cases.

**6. Tuberculosis:** This infectious disease has a high caseload of 84304, with 179 deaths. The disease continues to be a significant health challenge.

**7. Hepatitis:** Hepatitis in general has a large number of reported cases (135827), with hepatitis B (106985 cases) being the most common type. The diseases caused 53 deaths.

**8. Hand Foot and Mouth Disease:** This disease had a very high incidence with 193230 cases reported, but very low mortality with only 2 deaths.
