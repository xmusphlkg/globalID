Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 November.

Based on the provided data for infectious diseases in mainland China for November 2024, we can draw some key insights and highlight diseases that require particular attention, especially those with notable cases or deaths.

### Key Observations:

1. **Hepatitis**:
   - **Hepatitis B**: With 102,174 reported cases and 43 deaths, Hepatitis B continues to be a significant concern.
   - **Hepatitis C**: 20,327 cases and 7 deaths, indicating continued risk in the population.
   - **Other Hepatitis**: 19,116 cases and 30 deaths. These numbers suggest ongoing challenges related to viral hepatitis.

2. **Influenza**:
   - There is a notable increase in influenza cases, with **1,199,226 cases** and **4 deaths**. Although the death toll is relatively low, the number of cases indicates a seasonal surge that warrants public health vigilance.

3. **Tuberculosis**:
   - **Tuberculosis** shows **104,191 cases** and **131 deaths**, marking it as a critical ongoing issue, with substantial numbers of new infections and fatalities.

4. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**:
   - With **63,730 cases** and **3 deaths**, this disease is of concern, especially in pediatric populations, where it tends to be more prevalent.

5. **Dengue**:
   - The **1,767 cases** and **1 death** show that Dengue remains an active concern, although the numbers are lower compared to some other infectious diseases.

6. **Malaria**:
   - There are **54 confirmed cases** with **2 deaths**, which, though relatively low, still requires monitoring given the potential for the disease to spread in certain areas.

7. **Measles**:
   - **Measles** continues to be a health threat with **1,016 cases** and **2 deaths**. Despite vaccination efforts, sporadic outbreaks still occur.

8. **Mumps**:
   - A concerning rise in **mumps** with **7,019 cases** and **1 death** suggests that vaccination rates or immunity in certain populations may not be sufficient.

9. **Plague**:
   - The **7 cases** and **2 deaths** from **plague** are rare, but the serious nature of the disease means it should be closely monitored.

10. **Rabies**:
    - **Rabies** is critical with **238 cases** and **79 deaths**. This is an alarming number, especially since rabies is almost always fatal once symptoms appear.

11. **Typhoid and Paratyphoid Fever**:
    - **Typhoid fever** shows **6,049 cases** with **4 deaths**, pointing to continued risk in areas with lower sanitation.

12. **Leptospirosis**:
    - Though **Leptospirosis** has relatively fewer cases (**5 cases**), the **2 deaths** are notable, especially considering the disease's potential to spread in flood-prone areas.

### Diseases Requiring Particular Attention:

1. **Hepatitis B and C**: The large number of cases and deaths related to hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B, calls for sustained public health campaigns for prevention and treatment. Vaccination programs, improved screening, and better access to antiviral treatments are critical.

2. **Influenza**: While seasonal flu is common, the sharp rise in cases makes influenza surveillance and vaccination campaigns urgent, especially as the cold season approaches.

3. **Rabies**: With a high fatality rate and concerning case numbers, efforts to control rabies—through animal vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis for humans—need to be strengthened.

4. **Tuberculosis**: The persistent high incidence of TB suggests that efforts to control tuberculosis, including early detection and effective treatment, must remain a priority.

5. **Measles and Mumps**: Both diseases reflect gaps in vaccination coverage. Measles outbreaks, in particular, require swift action to increase vaccination rates and prevent further spread.

6. **Plague**: Though rare, plague remains a potential public health threat, requiring continued vigilance, particularly in high-risk areas.

### Conclusion:
Infectious diseases like **Hepatitis B**, **Influenza**, **Rabies**, and **Tuberculosis** need focused attention due to their high case numbers and mortality rates. Public health responses should prioritize these diseases while continuing to monitor others like **Measles**, **Dengue**, and **Plague** for potential outbreaks. Proactive vaccination programs, timely medical interventions, and public awareness are crucial in managing these threats effectively.
