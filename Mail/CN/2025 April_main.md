Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 April.

### Key Summary of Infectious Diseases in Mainland China – April 2025

#### **1. High-Burden Infectious Diseases (by total case volume)**

- **Hepatitis (total all types)**: Hepatitis remains one of the primary burdens, particularly:
  - **Hepatitis B**: ~3.5–4.5 million cases with ~500–700 deaths.
  - **Hepatitis C**: over 400,000 cases and rising.
  - **Combined hepatitis deaths**: exceed **1,500** for April alone.
- **Tuberculosis (TB)**:
  - Cases: Over **2.5 million cumulative** for April.
  - Deaths: **2,500–3,000+**, placing it second in mortality behind hepatitis.
- **Syphilis**:
  - Consistent with **~1.5–1.8 million cases** in April.
  - Mortality relatively low (under 50 total), suggesting widespread but manageable disease burden.

#### **2. Priority Diseases Based on Mortality**

- **Hepatitis B & C**:
  - Deaths consistently high across all weeks.
  - Particularly Hep C's sharp increase in mortality toward the end of April.
- **Tuberculosis**:
  - Second leading cause of death after hepatitis.
  - Urgent targeted control programs needed.
- **AIDS (HIV)**:
  - ~1500–2100 deaths/month with low case totals, indicating high lethality.
- **Rabies**:
  - Although case counts are low (10–30/month), the disease shows **100% fatality** (deaths equal to cases).
- **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**:
  - Significant mortality spikes in some weeks (e.g., up to 26 in week 17).
- **Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD)**:
  - High case burden (~1 million/month), but low mortality.
  - May warrant monitoring for atypical strains.

#### **3. Emerging or Fluctuating Threats**

- **Dengue Fever**:
  - Noteworthy spike in cases during week 14 (1604) with consistent reporting.
  - Potential seasonal/uprising trends.
- **COVID-19**:
  - Though lower than 2020 peaks, certain weeks (e.g., week 13, 65484 cases) show moderate resurgence – signals need for persistent surveillance.
- **Measles and Pertussis**:
  - Low to moderate spread continuing throughout April.
  - Require childhood vaccination programs to maintain control.

#### **4. Diseases with High Case Increases of Note**

- **Infectious Diarrhea**:
  - Surpassing HFMD in some weeks (~200,000+ cases).
- **Influenza**:
  - High seasonality observed, with peaks in several weeks; week 13 had **>600,000** cases.
  - Mortality low but extensive coverage due to capacity strain.

### Summary Recommendations

1. **Continue large-scale monitoring and treatment for TB and viral hepatitis**.
2. **Target AIDS with intensified treatment-adherence programs**, considering high death-to-case ratio.
3. **Enhance vaccination coverage** (measles, HFMD, pertussis).
4. **Strengthen response mechanisms to vector-borne illnesses** (dengue, hemorrhagic fevers) as seasonal spikes emerge.
5. **Maintain high alert for rabies** and ensure post-exposure prophylaxis availability.

> These findings underscore the continued importance of scalable public health surveillance, timely response systems, and vaccination infrastructure to minimize fluctuations and fatalities across infectious diseases.
