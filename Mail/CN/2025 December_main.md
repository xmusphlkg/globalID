Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 December.

### Key Points & Analysis: **Monthly Infectious Disease Cases and Deaths in Mainland China (December 2025)**

#### 1. **General Observations**

- The dataset covers a range of nationally notifiable infectious diseases reported by the 31 provincial-level divisions in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan).
- Figures represent both clinical and lab-confirmed cases; COVID-19 data is excluded per official policy.
- There are wide variations in case numbers, with some diseases showing thousands to millions of cases monthly, while others remain rare but sometimes highly fatal.

#### 2. **High-Burden Infectious Diseases**

**A. Highest Number of Cases**

| Disease                       | Approx. Monthly Cases (Dec 2025) | Deaths (Range)          | Notes                                |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Influenza                     | **millions** (e.g., 6,724,614) | 0–38                   | Dramatic seasonal upsurge, likely reflecting winter peak.             |
| Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease    | **hundreds of thousands**      | 0–3                    | High pediatric burden, usually low mortality; deserves ongoing vigilance. |
| Infectious Diarrhea           | **hundreds of thousands/millions** | 0-2                  | Excludes cholera, dysentery, typhoid. Transmission suggests food/water/sanitation concerns. |
| Hepatitis B & C               | **~100,000–170,000**           | moderate to high (B: up to 632, C: up to 589) | Chronic infections with substantial death tolls.                  |
| Syphilis                      | **40,000–61,000**              | 1–10                   | Maintains a moderate burden, low mortality.                          |
| Tuberculosis                  | **~48,000–80,000**             | High (up to 367)        | High chronic disease burden and notable death figures.               |
| Scarlet Fever                 | **~1,000–12,000**              | 0                      | Increasing cases but no reported deaths.                             |

**B. Notable Spikes**
- **Influenza cases exceeded 6.7 million in some months**, coinciding with the winter peak.
- **Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD)** frequently exceeded **400,000/month**, known for outbreaks among children.
- **Infectious diarrhea (excluding other enterics)** exceeded **3 million cases** in certain months.

#### 3. **Diseases with Significant Mortality**

| Disease                  | Deaths (Highest Monthly)      | Comments                                        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) | **2,131**            | Highest death count among chronic infectious diseases, though includes all-cause deaths among cumulative AIDS patients. |
| Hepatitis B, C, E        | B up to **632**, C up to **589**, E up to **3** | Deaths from chronic hepatitis remain a serious public health concern. Some months show striking increases; may signal acute complications or reporting changes. |
| Tuberculosis             | up to **367**                 | Continues to be a leading killer among infectious diseases.                |
| Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever | up to **26**               | Relatively rare but severe.                                    |
| Rabies                   | up to **30**                  | Nearly universally fatal, though cases are rare (~10–20/month).            |
| Japanese Encephalitis    | up to **3**                   | Sporadic and seasonal, but with high case-fatality.                        |
| Malaria                  | up to **4**                   | Low burden, but deaths persist (suggesting imported or drug-resistant cases).|
| Neonatal Tetanus         | up to **1**                   | Preventable; persistent cases highlight immunization gaps.                  |
| Plague                   | 1 case/death in some months   | Occasional, but requires strict vigilance.                                  |

---

#### 4. **Emerging and Epidemic-Prone Diseases**

- **Monkeypox**: Data labeled ‘nan’ (not available or zero), suggesting either absence, under-reporting, or lack of outbreaks in 2025.
- **Novel Influenza**: Sporadic reporting (nan, 3–5 cases in late months), but **no large outbreak detected**.
- **Dengue, Malaria**: No major outbreaks, but continued local or imported transmission.
- **Rabies**: Steady but low monthly incidence; very high mortality remains a concern.

---

#### 5. **Sexually Transmitted & Chronic Infectious Diseases**

| Disease    | Monthly Cases | Deaths       | Remarks                  |
|------------|--------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Gonorrhea  | ~6,000–12,000| 0/1 per month| High incidence, low mortality. |
| Syphilis   | ~40,000–60,000| Few per month| Needs ongoing screening, mother-to-child prevention. |
| AIDS       | ~1,458–2,131| very high    | Includes deaths from all causes among AIDS patients. Chronic management crucial. |

---

#### 6. **Low-Incidence, High-Risk Diseases**

- **Plague, Anthrax, Leptospirosis, Japanese Encephalitis, Kala Azar, Diphtheria:** All remain rare, but require ongoing vigilance due to high case-fatality rates or epidemic potential.
- **Neonatal tetanus**: Now extremely rare, indicating improved immunization, but any cases indicate gaps.
- **Rabies:** Fewer than 30 cases monthly, with most cases resulting in death.

---

#### 7. **Summary: Diseases Requiring Particular Attention**

- **Influenza**: *Huge winter upsurge*; authorities need to reinforce vaccination campaigns and surge capacity for respiratory illness.
- **Chronic Hepatitis (B, C)**: *High mortality*, continued transmission; highlights need for screening and antiviral therapy expansion.
- **Tuberculosis**: *Persistent high caseload and death rate*; ongoing need for case detection and treatment adherence.
- **AIDS**: *Consistently high mortality*, reflecting chronic management needs and gaps.
- **Hand, Foot & Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea**: Indicates endemic transmission, challenges in childcare, sanitation, and public health control.
- **Rabies, Japanese Encephalitis, Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**: Relatively rare, but **always deadly**; importance of post-exposure prophylaxis, vector control, and vaccination.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Influenza and enteric diseases (diarrhea, HFMD)** dominate in terms of case numbers, especially in winter.
- **Hepatitis B, C, AIDS, and Tuberculosis** remain the top killers among infectious diseases—implying a pressing need for stronger chronic disease management.
- *Rare diseases (rabies, anthrax, plague) persist*, underscoring the need for rapid case identification and containment.
- **Sexually transmitted infections** (syphilis, gonorrhea) continue to be widespread; preventive measures and neonatal interventions are crucial.
- **No major outbreaks of novel/emerging diseases detected** (e.g., Novel Influenza, Monkeypox) in December 2025.

> **Recommended Focus (December 2025):**  
> 1. Surge preparedness for **influenza and other respiratory illnesses**.  
> 2. **Chronic hepatitis and TB case-finding and treatment**.  
> 3. **AIDS management** and harm-reduction expansion.  
> 4. **Sanitation and childcare health** to reduce diarrheal and HFMD burden.  
> 5. **Rabies vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis** reinforcement.  
> 6. **Strengthen surveillance** for rare but epidemic-prone diseases.
