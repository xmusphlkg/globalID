Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 July.

The monthly data from July 2025 for cases and deaths related to various infectious diseases in mainland China presents several points requiring particular attention:

1. **COVID-19**: An exceptionally high number of COVID-19 cases are reported over multiple months, with significant volatility in reported numbers. The peak month reported over 440,000 cases with relatively few deaths compared to cases, indicating perhaps a shift in disease dynamics, a change in reporting practices, or effective disease management and treatment protocols. This disease remains a top priority given its potential for rapid spread and societal impact.

2. **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**: The AIDS data reflects high mortality with consistently over a thousand deaths each month, correlating with relatively stable case numbers. This highlights an ongoing concern with managing AIDS-related health complications and access to treatment. Although the numbers indicate a stable situation, the mortality rate is alarmingly high.

3. **Hepatitis**: There are high recorded cases for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and Hepatitis E, with notable deaths especially pertaining to Hepatitis C (peaking at 393 deaths in one month). Persistent high case numbers across different hepatitis strains could signify gaps in public health measures focusing on prevention and vaccination strategies.

4. **Tuberculosis**: Tuberculosis remains a significant health concern with monthly cases varying vastly between approximately 50,000 to 80,000 with consistently high deaths between 100 to over 300 deaths per month. Despite this being a longstanding public health challenge, its sustained high prevalence emphasizes the need for intensifying TB control programs and expanding treatment availability.

5. **Influenza**: Despite high cases, influenza-related deaths remain relatively low. However, with fluctuations in case numbers peaking at over 1.6 million in a month, the impact of influenza should not be underestimated, especially considering its potential overload on healthcare systems during peak seasons.

6. **Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV/AIDS)**: The mortality associated with HIV remains high relative to reported cases, underscoring ongoing issues in managing complications and comorbidities. Focused interventions are needed to address mortality rates.

7. **Emerging Concerns**:
   - **Monkey Pox**: As a reportable infectious disease included in the management of Class B infectious diseases, the emergence of Monkey Pox represents an additional concern for infectious disease surveillance and response.
   - **Dengue Fever**: Sporadic cases of dengue indicate a need for vigilant vector control activities, especially during peak transmission months.

8. **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**: While cases fluctuate, deaths remain low, suggesting possible effective management strategies but warranting continued monitoring due to the potential for sudden outbreaks.

Overall, while COVID-19 dominates the landscape in terms of case numbers, other infectious diseases like hepatitis and tuberculosis reflect ongoing public health struggles. This analysis points to the importance of strengthening disease surveillance, vaccination programs, and healthcare services to manage chronic and acute infectious diseases effectively, alongside continued vigilance for potential emerging infectious diseases.
