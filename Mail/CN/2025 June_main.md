Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 June.

Based on the provided data for diseases in Mainland China for June 2025, the following key points emerge:

1. **COVID-19:**
   - Substantial increase in cases: After several months of missing data from April to June, there is a reported surge to 440,662 cases in the last recorded month.
   - Deaths: In June, there were 7 recorded deaths related to COVID-19. Although the number is relatively low compared to some earlier periods, the significant spike in cases indicates an area that requires close monitoring.

2. **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):**
   - High mortality: Although the number of new cases has slightly decreased over the month, the number of deaths remained high, with 621 deaths reported in June, indicating that the disease is a significant health issue affecting a large portion of the population.

3. **Hepatitis:**
   - Hepatitis B: It remains the most prevalent with a consistent number of cases over the months. The deaths attributed to Hepatitis B in June are 35, showing a concerning level of mortality.
   - Hepatitis C: A notable rise in both cases and deaths, with deaths continuing at a concerning level, peaking at 305 by the end of June. This requires attention to better manage and implement preventative measures.
   - Hepatitis E: June saw 3 deaths. Although much lower compared to Hepatitis B and C, it could still benefit from closer observation.

4. **Human Infection with Avian Influenza Viruses:**
   - Although no cases were reported for H5N1, the slight decline of cases related to the H7N9 virus early in the year followed by no reported cases in subsequent months is noteworthy. Continued monitoring is recommended due to its potential for outbreaks.

5. **Acute Respiratory Infections:**
   - There was a significant increase in influenza cases, particularly in June with 1,172,398 cases but only 2 deaths, indicating widespread transmission with minimal mortality. Continued surveillance and vaccination efforts should be considered to manage the spread.

5. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease:**
   - There was a noticeable spike in cases in May and June, with 240,838 and 224,426 cases respectively, although with very few deaths. The high number suggests it is a common issue and could imply a need for public health campaigns to control its spread among vulnerable populations.

6. **Tuberculosis and Syphilis:**
   - Tuberculosis: The number of cases is relatively high each month, with May having 75,243 cases and June having 73,884 cases, alongside a significant number of deaths each month (average ~200). This indicates an ongoing health priority.
   - Syphilis: Reports a very high number of cases consistently across the months with relatively low mortality, which suggests the necessity for increased focus on prevention and treatment.

6. **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (EHF):**
   - The increase in both cases and deaths in June, reaching 2,402 cases and 26 deaths respectively, indicates a need for close monitoring and potential interventions to control the spread of this disease.

7. **Malaria, Japanese Encephalitis, and Rabies:**
   - While the total cases and deaths reported remain relatively low, diseases such as malaria, Japanese encephalitis, and rabies should be closely monitored due to some occurrence of mortality.

8. **Influenza:**
   - Notably high number of cases reported in June 3,000,232, with 14 deaths in the same month indicating a need for vaccination drives and better management strategies to handle the spread of influenza.

9. **Other Diseases:**
   - Other diseases like acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis and dengue have high case numbers but maintain low mortality rates, so they pose less immediate risk than those with higher mortality rates.
   - Brucellosis also has a consistently high number of cases but has seen a few deaths, which may require monitoring.

It is imperative to focus on reducing the spread and mortality rates of COVID-19, hepatitis, tuberculosis, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever through enhanced vaccination campaigns, public health policies, and education programs. Additionally, consistent data reporting and monitoring of diseases like malaria, rabies, and Japanese encephalitis should be maintained to prevent outbreaks.
