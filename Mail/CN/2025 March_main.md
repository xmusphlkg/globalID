Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 March.

### Summary Analysis of Infectious Diseases in Mainland China – March 2025

**1. Overall Burden**
- **Tuberculosis** remains the top infectious disease by case load with **63,000–75,000+ cases weekly**, totaling **~700,000+ in March**, and **approximately 320-370 deaths**.
- **Hepatitis B and C** are persistently high in case load, with millions of combined infections in March and multiple fatalities attributed to them.

### **2. High-Burden, High-Mortality Diseases**

#### **COVID-19**
- **Cases:** Surged dramatically to **~65,484 in one week (early March)** and reached peaks of **~70,000–75,000+ weekly** by the end of the month.
- **Deaths:** Sharp mortality event early March (**422 deaths** in one week), then fluctuated with occasional deaths in later weeks. Estimated monthly deaths: **~500+**.
- **Trend:** While cases decreased slightly toward the end, resurgence remains a concern.
- **Attention Needed:** Monitor for variant surges and reinforce vaccination/booster campaigns.

#### **Hepatitis B**
- **Cases:** Weekly cases ~100,000–150,000+, totaling over **1.5 million** in March.
- **Deaths:** Consistent weekly mortality ~30–70, totaling **~600+ deaths/month**.
- **Attention Needed:** National immunization and antiviral strategies remain imperative.

#### **Hepatitis C**
- **Cases:** ~15,000–20,000 new cases weekly.
- **Deaths:** Mortality spiked in late March (**305–454 deaths/week**), with total **estimated deaths >1000 in March**.
- **Attention Needed:** Rising mortality needs urgent assessment; possibly linked to disease progression or under-treatment.

#### **Influenza**
- **Cases:** Explosive growth in March; highest recorded at **~1.67 million** in one week.
- **Deaths:** ~300–400 weekly by end-March, totaling over **1,500 deaths/month**.
- **Trend:** Major flu season impact.
- **Attention Needed:** Vaccine coverage, strain surveillance, and elderly protection required.

### **3. Outbreaks and Emerging Threats**

#### **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**
- **Cases:** Rising trend with peaks at **2400+ weekly**.
- **Deaths:** Notable weekly fatalities (e.g., **26 deaths in early March**).
- **Attention Needed:** Potential outbreak signs; requires vector control and public education.

#### **Measles**
- Gradual resurgence seen; weekly cases reached **~176** (late March).
- **Note:** Low fatalities, but immunization gaps need monitoring.

#### **Hepatitis E**
- Cases remained stable (~1,700–3,500 weekly), but spikes in **late March with 1–3 deaths/week** nearing total **~15+ deaths**.
- Often linked to fecal–oral transmission and unsafe food/water.

---

### **4. Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)**

#### **Syphilis**
- **Cases:** ~40,000–60,000 weekly. 
- **Deaths:** ~1–10 deaths/week.
- **Trend:** Very high prevalence; continuous control strategy required.

#### **Gonorrhea**
- Shockingly high weekly load (**8,000–12,000+ cases** frequently).
- No mortality, but signals high community transmission.

---

### **5. Rare but Lethal Diseases**
- **Rabies**: Only a few cases monthly, but **consistently fatal (100% mortality)**.
  - **March Deaths:** >10 reported.
- **Anthrax** and **Meningococcal meningitis**: Few cases, but isolated deaths reported (e.g., **1 death in 123 anthrax cases** and sporadic meningococcal deaths).
- **Attention Needed:** Monitor zoonotic threats with sporadic but deadly profiles.

---

### **6. Diarrheal/Enteric Diseases**

#### **Infectious Diarrhea & Dysentery**
- Combined, over **150,000–200,000 cases/month**.
- Mild mortality, but indicative of hygiene or water issues.

#### **Typhoid/Paratyphoid**
- Consistent moderate prevalence (~400–900 weekly).
- Low mortality, but focus needed in sanitation-critical regions.

---

### **7. Pediatric Diseases**
- **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD):**
  - Surged massively: weekly peaks near **~450,000+ (end March)**.
  - Extremely low death rate (1–2/week) but **public health burden high** due to outbreaks and youth susceptibility.

---

### Conclusion: **Diseases Requiring Special Attention**
1. **Influenza** – Strongest wave in years; strain monitoring and vaccination critical.
2. **COVID-19** – March saw sharp increases and renewed weekly deaths.
3. **Hepatitis B & C** – Long-term burden and fatality demand ongoing attention.
4. **Epidemic hemorrhagic fever**, **HFMD**, and **syphilis** – Emerging/hyperendemic diseases needing control measures.
5. **Rabies** – Still 100% fatal; must maintain vaccine availability and exposure awareness.
