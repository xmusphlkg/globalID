Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 May.

### Key Summary of Infectious Disease Trends in Mainland China — **May 2025**

#### 1. **General Overview**
- **COVID-19** saw a **large resurgence**, peaking significantly on certain days:
  - Highest recorded daily **cases** reached: **168,507**
  - **Total deaths** observed on 2025-05-31: **9 deaths**
- **Total infectious disease burden** remained substantial, with multiple diseases exceeding:
  - **100,000 monthly reported cases**, especially influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth (HFMD), hepatitis B, and infectious diarrhea.

---

#### 2. **Diseases Requiring Special Attention**

##### **a. COVID-19**
- **Spike:** May 31 saw the highest single-day case count of **168,507**.
- **Total for May (summed daily, ignoring NANs):** over 500,000 cases with multiple death days.
- **Trend:** Highly volatile with sudden spikes, indicating localized outbreaks or reporting batch updates.
- **Concern:** Mutant strain and public health response adequacy need investigation.

##### **b. **Hepatitis Family (B & C)**
- **Hepatitis B:**
  - Daily average: ~100,000–140,000 cases
  - May 31: **137,442 cases, 34 deaths**
- **Hepatitis C:**
  - Gradually rising: peaked at **23,214 cases**, **176 deaths** in May.
- **Hepatitis E & other types** occasionally show >3,000 cases/day but with fewer deaths.

**Key Concern:** Chronic hepatitis increases long-term liver disease risk and remains a **top priority for vaccination and screening**.

##### **c. Tuberculosis (TB)**
- **Steady burden**: Daily cases around **60,000–70,000+**
- **Notable deaths:** Up to **365 deaths in a single day** (May 31).
- **Implication:** TB continues to be the **leading high-mortality infectious disease**, needing sustained national TB control efforts.

##### **d. Influenza**
- **Massive case increase:** Reached **1.67 million cases** on May 31 alone.
- **Deaths:** Up to **31 deaths/day**
- **Trend:** Surging, possibly seasonal but **not typical** for influenza patterns in summer months.
  
##### **e. Hand-Foot-and-Mouth Disease (HFMD)**
- Persistent throughout the month with some days peaking **over 400,000 cases**
- Particularly high among children during spring and early summer.
- Very **low fatality rate**, but **major burden on pediatric care systems**.

#### 3. **Other High-Impact Diseases**

| Disease                          | Max Cases/Day      | Max Deaths/Day     | Notes |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-------|
| **Infectious Diarrhea**         | 227,604             | 2                   | Major pediatric morbidity |
| **Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis** | 125,264             | 0                   | Rapidly spread, no deaths |
| **Dengue Fever**                | 11,083              | 1                   | Low fatality, potential epidemic indicator |
| **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever** | 2,402               | 26                  | Sporadic surges—needs monitoring |
| **Rabies**                      | Max daily **21 cases**, up to **3 daily deaths** | Still endemic in some areas |
| **Measles**                     | Up to 306 daily cases | Rare deaths (1–2) | Resurgence in under-vaccinated regions likely |

---

#### 4. **Summary of Concerns by Fatality**

| Disease     | Fatality Concern |
|-------------|------------------|
| **COVID-19**    | Resurgent threat, unpredictable spikes |
| **Tuberculosis** | Persistent No.1 in death toll |
| **Hepatitis C**  | Increasing mortality trend |
| **Influenza**    | Shocking spike on May 31 – possibly data backlog |
| **Rabies**       | Still causes preventable deaths |
| **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever & Measles** | Unexpected surges, especially with deaths – require surveillance |

---

### 5. **Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **COVID-19 requires renewed monitoring**, despite global easing.
- **Influenza surge** is anomalous—data verification or outbreak explanation is warranted.
- **Vaccination for hepatitis B, measles, HFMD (enterovirus 71)**, and **HPV** must be strengthened.
- **Tuberculosis programs need reinforcement**, including drug-resistance surveillance.
- **Better reporting granularity, especially daily vs cumulative spikes**, would improve interpretation and response.
