Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 November.

The data on infectious disease cases and deaths in mainland China for November 2025 highlights several key points and areas requiring particular attention:

1. **COVID-19**: The number of cases for COVID-19 surged significantly in November 2025, reaching 440,662 cases with 7 reported deaths. This requires particular attention due to the resurgence of cases, likely necessitating increased public health measures, vaccination drives, and potential lockdowns to control the spread.

2. **Respiratory Infections**: Influenza remains a significant concern with 4,770,856 reported cases, although deaths remained low (38 in one category). The rise in cases emphasizes the need for vaccination campaigns and public awareness to mitigate the spread, particularly during the flu season.

3. **Dengue and Malaria**: Tropical diseases such as Dengue had a notable number of cases (several months had case numbers above 1,000), although mortality remains low. Malaria also showed consistent reporting through the months. These diseases highlight the need for vector control programs and ongoing surveillance, especially in southern regions where conditions for transmission are more favorable.

4. **Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)**: Syphilis continues to be a significant public health issue with over 61,013 reported cases and 1 potential death. Gonorrhea and other STIs also showed high numbers, suggesting the need for enhanced sexual health education, testing, and treatment services.

5. **Tuberculosis**: With 996,866 cases and 3 deaths reported, Tuberculosis remains a major infectious disease concern. Continuous efforts in TB prevention, timely diagnosis, and treatment adherence are necessary given the magnitude of cases.

6. **Viral Hepatitis**: Hepatitis B and C cases remain prevalent with 1,575,657 and 20,022 reported cases respectively. The efforts towards hepatitis prevention through vaccination for hepatitis B and treatment programs for managing hepatitis C need to be maintained and strengthened.

7. **Emerging Infections**: Diseases such as Monkeypox (introduced into Class B management) require monitoring and public health readiness to prevent outbreaks. Although specific numbers for Monkeypox were not provided, attention to any emerging infectious diseases is crucial.

8. **Gastroenteritis-Related Infections**: Infectious diarrhea excluded from cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever had a significant incidence with over 6,353,000 reported cases, underscoring issues with sanitation and the need for improved public health infrastructure.

9. **Novel Influenza and other Influenza strains**: While cases remain high in Influenza categories (659,225 in various distinctions), it posed a lower mortality risk. Continued vigilance and surveillance are necessary to preempt potential pandemic strains that may arise.

10. **Zoonotic and Vector-borne Challenges**: Anthrax, which saw sporadic yet noticeable spikes in case counts, and other diseases like brucellosis emphasize the interplay between human and animal health, indicating the need for a One Health approach.

In summary, while COVID-19 remains a primary concern with rising cases, other diseases such as influenza, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis continue to pose significant challenges. Investments in public health infrastructure, vaccination programs, disease surveillance, and education on preventive measures are critical to managing these infectious diseases effectively. Additionally, the management of vector-borne and sexually transmitted diseases remains vital for comprehensive public health strategies.
