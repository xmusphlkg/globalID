Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 October.

Based on the data for October 2025, the following key points emerge regarding infectious diseases in mainland China:

1. **COVID-19**:
   - The month of October experienced a significant resurgence in COVID-19 cases, with an exceptionally high number of cases reaching 440,662 and deaths reported as 7. This shows a substantial increase from previous months, highlighting an area that demands immediate and heightened attention.

2. **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS)**:
   - The number of AIDS cases was relatively stable at 5,264, but the associated deaths remained high at 1,987. It is important to note that these death figures represent all-cause mortality among AIDS patients.

3. **Hepatitis**:
   - Hepatitis infections continue to be widespread, particularly Hepatitis B and C. Hepatitis B had 113,974 cases with 34 deaths, and Hepatitis C had 17,894 cases with 176 deaths. These figures underscore the need for sustained public health interventions focused on these infections.

4. **Tuberculosis**:
   - Tuberculosis remains a significant burden with 59,246 cases and 252 deaths. The persistent high case load indicates the necessity for ongoing TB control efforts, including diagnosis and treatment strategies.

5. **Influenza**:
   - Reported flu cases were extraordinarily high with 1,679,786 cases and 41 deaths, indicating a potential influenza outbreak that requires close monitoring and robust public health response to limit transmission.

6. **Dengue and Cholera**:
   - Dengue witnessed 1,702 cases but no reported deaths, whereas Cholera, while having a low case count of 5, had no deaths reported. Both diseases require proactive vector control and public awareness campaigns to mitigate further spread.

7. **Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease**:
   - This disease saw 227,604 cases during the month. While not typically life-threatening, the high number of cases suggests a need for public health education and preventive measures.

8. **Rabies**:
   - Rabies cases remain relatively low at 6, but the fatality rate is high, highlighting the critical importance of rabies vaccination programs for both humans and animals.

9. **Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever**:
   - There was a significant reported increase in cases of epidemic hemorrhagic fever with 122 cases noted.

10. **Schistosomiasis**:
    - Despite historic efforts to control schistosomiasis, it remains with 1,154 cases but relatively well-controlled with no reported deaths.

This data portrays a substantial public health burden from infectious diseases in China, with COVID-19 and viral hepatitis being primary concerns. Enhanced surveillance, vaccination campaigns, and public health interventions are essential to control the spread and impact of these diseases. These efforts should particularly target diseases showing an upward trend in cases or a high mortality rate.
