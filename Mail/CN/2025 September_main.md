Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2025 September.

Based on the provided monthly data for September 2025, here is an analysis and summary focusing on infectious diseases that require particular attention:

### Key Points on Infectious Diseases:

1. **Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS):**
   - **Cases:** The reported cases for AIDS remain consistently high throughout the month with numbers ranging from around 1,815 to 6,508 cases.
   - **Deaths:** Notably, the deaths recorded are significant, ranging from 1,052 to 2,486, indicating high mortality among those diagnosed.

2. **COVID-19:**
   - **Cases & Deaths:** There is a significant spike reported with numerous fluctuations in case numbers, ranging from 529 to 440,662 throughout the month. The data suggests that costs are still high and warrant close monitoring despite the variations in reporting.

3. **Hepatitis (Variants A, B, C, D, E):**
   - **Cases:** Hepatitis B and C continue to show substantial numbers, with cases often exceeding 100,000. However, mortality rates for Hepatitis C are notably higher than the variants.
   - **Deaths:** Hepatitis C has a high death count, peaking at 393 deaths, indicating the need for enhanced clinical management and treatment availability.

4. **Tuberculosis:**
   - **Cases:** Rates are persistently high across the month, with reported cases exceeding 50,000.
   - **Deaths:** While lower than cases, death counts fluctuate between 56 to 365, suggesting ongoing public health challenges.

5. **Influenza:**
   - **Cases:** Influenza cases witnessed substantial variability, with peaks reported over months indicating prevalent seasonal variations.
   - **Deaths:** Although not listed, mortality tends to complicate the burden this disease poses, especially during colder months.

6. **Syphilis:**
   - **Cases & Deaths:** Both reported cases (over 40,000) and deaths (up to 9) indicate an ongoing public health concern. Effective control and treatment remain necessary.

7. **Dengue Fever:**
   - **Cases:** Significant number fluctuations from 3 to 5,388 cases indicate dengue outbreaks.
   - **Deaths:** Though deaths are minimal for Dengue, the potential for outbreaks requires vigilant vector control measures.

8. **Monkeypox:**
   - **Management:** Included in Class B diseases since September 2023, cases are notably low or not reported, suggesting controlled measures may be effective.

9. **Anthrax:**
   - **Cases & Deaths:** There is a notable case count variability, with cases possibly reaching 120, requiring increased preventive measures.

10. **Scarlet Fever:** 
    - **Cases:** Peaks at different points, but relatively lower mortality, indicating control efforts need to focus on case prevention.

### Diseases Requiring Particular Attention:
- **HIV/AIDS:** Due to high death tolls associated with AIDS.
- **COVID-19:** With significant spikes in cases indicating it remains a public health priority.
- **Hepatitis C:** Due to its high mortality.
- **Tuberculosis and Syphilis:** Persistent case numbers and mortality illustrate ongoing challenges.
- **Dengue Fever and Anthrax:** Monitoring and management required ongoing due to potential outbreaks.

### Conclusion:
Despite progress in managing various infectious diseases, those identified above continue to pose significant public health burdens requiring strategic focus. Seasonal fluctuations, vector control, clinical management, and public health interventions are critical to mitigate disease impacts. Regular updates and monitoring of trends can help optimize responses and allocate resources efficiently.
