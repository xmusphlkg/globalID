Dear [Recipient],

I hope this email finds you well. China CDC has published the new data on the cases and deaths of notifiable infectious diseases in Chinese mainland in 2024 May.

**1. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome:** In May 2024, mainland China has reported 6404 new cases and 1726 deaths due to AIDS. The disease has maintained an extremely high mortality rate with approximately 27% of those confirmed with the virus in May succumbing.

**2. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis:** We've seen a significant number of new cases - 4208 in total. However, only one death was attributed to this disease indicating a low fatality rate.

**3. Anthrax:** There have been 66 reported cases of Anthrax in May with one resultant death. Introduction and execution of effective treatment plans could be the reason for low fatality.

**4. Brucellosis:** With no deaths and 4755 new cases, managing the spread of brucellosis appears to be effective in terms of preventing fatalities but less so in terms of controlling its spread.

**5. Cholera:**  Only 12 cases have been reported in May and no deaths were reported.

**6. Dengue:** Dengue infection is quite common with 3311 new cases, however, no fatalities were reported.

**7. Diphtheria:** No case has been reported in the mainland in May 2024.
