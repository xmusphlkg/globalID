## Introduction

## Overview

In July 2025, the Chinese mainland continued to battle various infectious diseases. The most notable in terms of case numbers was Hepatitis, with different types collectively totaling 1,124,655 cases. Hepatitis B, followed by Hepatitis C, reported the highest number of cases with 140,564 and 21,905 respectively. Tuberculosis remained a significant concern with 68,295 reported cases. Among sexually transmitted diseases, Gonorrhea and Syphilis also showed high numbers with 50,927 and 62,437 cases respectively. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) reported 5,295 cases, highlighting the continued challenge of managing chronic infectious conditions. The influenza virus, with 65,883 cases, demonstrated typical seasonal variance, demonstrating the continued pressure it places on public health systems.

In terms of mortality, the same month recorded 2664 deaths across various diseases, which include deaths among AIDS patients not necessarily directly caused by the disease. Hepatitis C (209 deaths) and Hepatitis B (42 deaths) exhibited relatively high mortality rates due to their potential complications. Emerging and reemerging pathogens retained focus, such as avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9, which did not record any human cases, indicating effective containment measures but continued vigilance is necessary. The prominent rise in temperature-related illnesses, such as incidence spikes in Dengue and Chikungunya, posits climate-influenced patterns that require attention to future prevention strategies.

## Concerns

High incidence rates of Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) reported at 193,538 cases point to consistent recurrent outbreaks among children. Although the mortality from HFMD is low, its prevalence indicates a significant burden on healthcare resources with implications for public health policy. Tuberculosis also remains a major public health concern due to its incidence and potential for spreading in densely populated regions. The reduction in malaria and measles cases suggests successful wider vaccination initiatives; however, the reported cases during this period suggest that further efforts are needed as public health measures must ensure sustained efforts in vaccination coverage and vector control.

Public concern notably focused on Hepatitis B and C, compounded by their high incidence rates and their potential for chronic progression leading to liver diseases. Given the high mortality rate associated with Hepatitis B and C, comprehensive public health strategies are crucial for tackling the transmission routes, particularly through mobilization of vaccination campaigns and improving healthcare access. Additionally, the rise in incidences of sexually transmitted infections such as Gonorrhea and Syphilis requires enhanced public health strategies, focusing on increased access to education, screenings, and treatments for affected populations.

## Recommendations

Firstly, considering the reported significant number of HFMD cases, public health authorities should prioritize educational campaigns targeting hygiene and awareness among the public, particularly among caregivers and healthcare providers dealing with pediatric populations. Strategies should include information on recognizing symptoms early, maintaining hygiene practices in childcare settings, and promoting vaccination where available to curtail outbreaks.

Secondly, addressing Hepatitis B and C necessitates relentless vaccination campaigns, especially in rural and susceptible areas. Efforts should be made to ensure wide vaccine coverage and availability of antiviral treatments. Strengthening healthcare infrastructure to allow easier access to diagnosis and treatment for Hepatitis B and C is paramount to control infections effectively and reduce mortality.

Moreover, addressing Tuberculosis, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis requires a multifaceted approach, including improved detection capabilities, patient-centered care designed to enhance adherence to antibiotic regimens, and public health education campaigns to reduce stigma and improve health-seeking behavior. In addition, resources should focus on prevention strategies especially concerning increased screenings, vaccinations where available, and deploying rapid testing technologies.

For emerging diseases, especially those impacted by climatic changes such as Dengue, there should be concerted efforts to develop robust vector-control programs. Surveillance systems should be strengthened to detect early outbreaks, and regional healthcare networks should be prepared to manage infectious bursts efficiently. Innovative environmental management should be encouraged in urban areas to minimize breeding grounds for vector species.

Finally, ongoing emphasis on universal healthcare and public education is vital. Broadening access to healthcare resources and promoting health literacy will empower populations to undertake proactive health behaviors, curtailing unnecessary disease spread. Authorities should ensure solid public health infrastructure, reliable supply chains for medications and vaccines, and effective intergovernmental cooperation to enhance disease control measures both within the nation and across borders.

Overall, the diverse epidemiological landscape in the Chinese mainland requires adaptable and head-on strategies to address the multitude of infectious diseases facing the populace. High incidence diseases such as Hepatitis, HFMD, and Tuberculosis should remain focal points for public health interventions, mandating consistent surveillance, reporting, community outreach, and resource allocation to decrease the prevalent disease burden and mortality rates in subsequent months.
