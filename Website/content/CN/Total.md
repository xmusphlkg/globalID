## Introduction

## Overview

In August 2025, the Chinese mainland experienced a notable increase in the prevalence of various infectious diseases. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) remained a significant concern, with 5,978 reported cases and an alarming number of deaths, totaling 1,554 in one month. Hepatitis B showed a persistent high incidence, with 101,633 cases, while infectious diarrhea surged with 179,418 cases. The spike in infectious diarrhea was significant, underscoring an urgent need for improved public health strategies. Meanwhile, hand, foot, and mouth disease reached a whopping 224,426 cases, leading to heightened public apprehension. Noteworthy, tuberculosis cases were reported as 69,072, indicating the disease's persistent nature despite ongoing public health efforts.

Regarding mortality, AIDS reported 1,554 deaths, echoing previous months' trends with considerable all-cause mortality. Hepatitis C recorded 13 deaths, marking a moderate concern due to its long-term health repercussions. COVID-19 contributors to mortality were notably high, with 9 fatalities, highlighting its continued presence. The overall mortality landscape was shaped by the synergistic effects of prevalent diseases such as Hepatitis C and AIDS, both fueling overarching health burdens. The presence of multiple infectious diseases with varying mortality rates demands strategic interventions to mitigate these impacts effectively.

## Concerns

In terms of high incidence diseases, hand, foot, and mouth disease led with the highest case numbers, totaling 224,426, reflecting endemic characteristics in vulnerable populations. The spread suggests a potential link to environmental factors and personal hygiene practices, primarily affecting children in densely populated areas. Tuberculosis remains endemic, contributing to a grim tally of 69,072 cases for the month. Despite many decades of control measures, this age-old disease still challenges public health officials due to slow recovery timelines and prolonged treatment courses. A spike in Hepatitis B cases, numbering 101,633, continues to pose a severe regional concern due to its chronic nature and potential for complicated progression.

Public concern intensified as infectious diarrhea cases skyrocketed to 179,418. The alarming surge amplifies the urgency for improved sanitation and hygiene measures. COVID-19's mortality toll heightened public anxiety, despite relatively lower case numbers (440,662). Efforts to control the disease are ongoing, with the emphasis on vaccinations and public health education. Dengue cases increased to 5,201, a seasonal concern due to its vector-borne nature and climatic influences, often leading to vector control efforts during peak transmission seasons. The resurgence of rubella (4,192 cases) marked an unexpected trend, raising alarm about vaccination uptake and surveillance precision.

## Recommendations

Given the disease landscape in August 2025, several public health recommendations emerge to address key concerns. First, enhance surveillance and monitoring systems for hand, foot, and mouth disease, especially in childcare settings where transmission rates are highest. It is essential to promote handwashing and environmental cleaning strategies within communities. Boost vaccinations for Hepatitis B and indeed other viral infections insidiously spreading in densely populated areas, interrupting transmission and preventing long-term complications.

Enhancing the fight against tuberculosis requires ramping up data sharing and healthcare accessibility in underserved areas. Supportive measures such as mobile health clinics and telemedicine should be leveraged to ensure comprehensive healthcare delivery and compliance with lengthy TB treatment plans. Boost nutritional programs that strengthen immunity against infectious diseases, especially among vulnerable groups, including children and the elderly, encountering diseases like tuberculosis and influenza.

To curb infectious diarrhea, strict improvements in public sanitation infrastructure are critical. Encourage urban and rural communities alike to adopt proven water treatment and sanitation techniques as well as consumer safe handling practices. Conduct widespread community health workshops to promote awareness and adoption of these sanitary practices and engage community leaders in health advocacy roles.

Moreover, sustained efforts to control COVID-19 are paramount, urging continuous albeit personalized vaccine delivery and public workshops to quell misinformation. Institutionally, increase healthcare capacities for disease surveillance teams to pinpoint hotspots expediently, even adapting containment zones based on the latest data trends. Continue leveraging modern technologies such as AI in analyzing massive epidemiological data sets and forecasting potential disease outbreaks.

Finally, maintain vigilance over vector-borne diseases like dengue, closely correlating health measures with climatic changes. Community-led programs focusing on mosquito control, community surveillance, and climate adaptation programs will be pivotal in preventing vector proliferation. Collaborative government initiatives involving international health organizations for targeted vector control strategies and resources mobilization will further support regional efforts.

Overall, enhancing public health infrastructure, prompting community engagement, and fostering innovative health strategies will bolster efforts to mitigate infectious disease prevalence and empower citizens to champion health resilience across regions.
