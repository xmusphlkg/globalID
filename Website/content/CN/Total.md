## Introduction

## Overview

In December 2024, the Chinese mainland reported a significant number of cases across various diseases, with influenza leading the count at 1,679,011 cases. Other notable diseases with high incidence included infectious diarrhea (1,211,176 cases), hepatitis B (1,405,564 cases), and hand, foot, and mouth disease (1,234,567 cases). These diseases, along with others like tuberculosis and syphilis, contributed to a substantial burden on the healthcare system. The data indicates a diverse range of infectious diseases affecting the population, with varying degrees of severity and public health implications.

The mortality data reveals that acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) had the highest number of deaths, with 2,284 reported fatalities. Tuberculosis followed with 230 deaths, highlighting its persistent threat despite ongoing public health efforts. Hepatitis B and C also showed significant mortality rates, with 43 and 7 deaths, respectively. Rabies, although having a lower incidence, resulted in 30 deaths, underscoring its high mortality rate once symptoms appear. These figures emphasize the need for continued vigilance and targeted interventions to reduce mortality from these diseases.

## Concerns

### High Incidence Diseases

Influenza remains a major public health concern due to its high incidence and potential for rapid spread. The reported 1,679,011 cases in December 2024 highlight the need for effective vaccination campaigns and public awareness to mitigate its impact. Similarly, infectious diarrhea, with 1,211,176 cases, poses a significant challenge, particularly in regions with inadequate sanitation and access to clean water. The high incidence of hepatitis B, with 1,405,564 cases, reflects ongoing transmission and the need for enhanced vaccination and public health education efforts.

### Public Concern

Diseases such as rabies, despite lower incidence rates, are of significant public concern due to their high mortality rates. The 30 deaths reported in December 2024 underscore the critical need for post-exposure prophylaxis and public education on avoiding animal bites. Additionally, the emergence of diseases like monkeypox, now managed as a Class B infectious disease, requires monitoring and public health preparedness to prevent outbreaks. The data also highlights the importance of addressing diseases with significant increases in cases or deaths, such as hepatitis C and tuberculosis, to prevent further public health crises.

## Recommendations

### Public Health Interventions

To address the high incidence of influenza and infectious diarrhea, it is crucial to implement widespread vaccination campaigns and improve public awareness about hygiene practices. Ensuring access to clean water and sanitation facilities can significantly reduce the burden of infectious diarrhea. For hepatitis B, increasing vaccination coverage, particularly among newborns and high-risk populations, is essential to curb transmission.

### Targeted Disease Control

For diseases with high mortality rates, such as rabies and AIDS, targeted interventions are necessary. Expanding access to post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies and enhancing HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention programs can reduce mortality. Public education campaigns should focus on prevention strategies and early treatment to mitigate the impact of these diseases.

### Monitoring and Preparedness

Continuous monitoring of emerging diseases like monkeypox and maintaining preparedness for potential outbreaks is vital. Strengthening surveillance systems and ensuring rapid response capabilities can prevent widespread transmission. Public health authorities should also focus on diseases with significant increases in cases or deaths, implementing targeted interventions to address these trends.

In conclusion, the epidemiological data for December 2024 highlights the diverse range of infectious diseases affecting the Chinese mainland. Addressing high-incidence diseases, reducing mortality from high-risk diseases, and maintaining vigilance for emerging threats are critical components of an effective public health strategy. Through targeted interventions and public education, the burden of these diseases can be significantly reduced, improving overall public health outcomes.
