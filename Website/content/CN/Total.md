## Introduction

## Overview

### Cases Analysis
In September 2025, Chinese mainland experienced a diverse epidemiological landscape with various infectious diseases affecting the population. Among the diseases with the highest number of cases were Influenza, Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD), infectious diarrhea, and various types of Hepatitis. Influenza topped the list with a staggering 4,113,286 cases, driven largely by its seasonal nature and high transmissibility, representing a significant burden on the healthcare system. Meanwhile, HFMD, a common pediatric disease, recorded 447,212 cases, continuing to challenge public health efforts due to its ease of transmission in preschool settings. Infectious diarrhea, excluding cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever, contributed 1,794,180 cases, reflecting ongoing issues with water and food safety. Hepatitis-related cases, including Hepatitis B, C, and E, were also prominent, showcasing the continued need for effective vaccination and treatment programs.

### Deaths Analysis
Regarding fatalities, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), COVID-19, and various hepatitis types contributed significantly to the mortality burden. Recordings showed 5,356 deaths from AIDS, highlighting the long-term challenges associated with managing immunocompromised states despite advancements in treatment. COVID-19 accounted for 1,935 deaths, indicating ongoing impacts of the virus even as pandemic conditions subside globally. Hepatitis-related mortality was notably high, especially Hepatitis E with 1,950 recorded deaths, emphasizing the need for continued efforts in hepatitis vaccine development and implementation. Other diseases such as tuberculosis, Influenza, and rabies had relatively smaller death numbers but continued to present public health challenges partly due to delays in diagnosis and treatment access.

## Concerns

### High Incidence Diseases
Influenza and HFMD remain high incidence diseases, with Influenza showing an exceptional case count of over 4 million. Its prevalence is undoubtedly driven by its seasonal resurgence, exacerbated by suboptimal vaccination coverage and variability in virus strains. HFMD cases, dominant during warmer months when children are more exposed to one another, continue to highlight transmission dynamics in communal settings such as schools and daycare centers. The spike in infectious diarrhea cases points to ongoing infrastructural deficits in sanitation and water safety, necessitating robust surveillance.

### Diseases of Public Concern
COVID-19 remains a major public health concern, its impact evident in mortality figures. Despite vaccines and treatments being available, its persistent presence indicates the continual importance of maintaining vaccine campaigns and public health surveillance systems. AIDS-related deaths also remain significant, suggesting a need for reinforcing awareness and accessibility of antiviral therapies. Hepatitis E's alarming mortality rate, with 1,950 deaths, underscores endemic issues requiring urgent public health interventions for water and sanitation improvement. Rabies is particularly concerning due to its nearly 100% case-fatality rate once symptoms appear, indicating a pressing need for improved animal control measures and post-exposure prophylaxis.

## Recommendations

### Enhancing Surveillance and Prevention
Given the high incidence of influenza and HFMD, it is crucial to bolster vaccination campaigns and preventive measures. Enhancing vaccine accessibility can reduce influenza transmission significantly and mitigate potential outbreaks. For HFMD, increased health education targeting parents and caregivers in schools is vital to limit transmission, alongside improved sanitation practices. Leveraging technology for real-time monitoring and surveillance can enable swift identification and containment of outbreaks.

### Strengthening Healthcare Infrastructure and Access
Efforts must be increased to enhance healthcare infrastructure, making accessible diagnostic and therapeutic services for diseases with high mortality rates like AIDS and different types of hepatitis. Expanding treatment coverage and reducing cost barriers will encourage more patients to seek early intervention and improve outcomes. The integration of mobile health solutions can facilitate outreach to rural areas where healthcare access is limited.

### Public Awareness and Education Campaigns
Educating the population on the importance of vaccination, especially regarding Influenza and hepatitis, is vital. Public campaigns should stress the safety and efficacy of vaccines, debunking misinformation that hinders vaccine uptake. Community engagement using culturally relevant materials can improve acceptability and reinforce preventive measures. Additionally, campaigns addressing COVID-19 should focus on continued vigilance and the benefits of vaccination despite reduced immediate threat perception.

In summary, the epidemiological profile for Chinese mainland in September 2025 presents challenges and opportunities for enhancing public health responses. By addressing high incidence rates through effective surveillance, strengthening healthcare access, and promoting comprehensive educational campaigns, public health stakeholders can mitigate disease impacts and enhance community resilience against these diseases.
