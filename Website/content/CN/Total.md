## Introduction

## Overview

In May 2025, infectious and non-infectious diseases continued to pose a substantial burden on public health across mainland China. Overall, the month reported varied trends in case incidence and mortality across different disease categories. Among infectious diseases, Tuberculosis (TB) exhibited a consistently high incidence with 61,185 cases, although this revealed a marginal decline against the previous months. COVID-19, having stabilizing tendencies due to stringent interventions and vaccine coverage, nonetheless demonstrated a pointed resurgence with 65,484 cases, marking a significant concern for health authorities. Additionally, Hepatitis infections, notably Hepatitis B and C, remained prevalent with significant case numbers of 96,933 and 17,712, respectively.

Notable in the mortality landscape, COVID-19 had the highest death toll with 422 fatalities attributed this month, indicating continued pandemic implications despite control efforts. Rabies, a largely preventable condition, showed a persistently worrying mortality rate with 20 deaths from just 9 cases, underscoring issues in early detection and vaccination outreach. Additionally, Tuberculosis maintained a high mortality count with 341 deaths, proving complex to manage due to drug-resistant strains and the logistical challenges of long-term treatment adherence. AIDS-related deaths also remained notable with 1,052 fatalities, highlighting ongoing concerns about access to antiretroviral therapies and early diagnosis.

## Concerns

High incidence diseases such as Hand, Foot, and Mouth Disease (HFMD) and Influenza showcased persistent public health challenges with 144,447 and 37,567 reported cases respectively in May 2025. The HFMD incidence, particularly in children, reflected the necessity for enhanced hygienic practices and targeted health education in schools and daycare environments. Influenza, even with available preventive vaccinations, continued to show significant seasonal spikes, emphasizing the need for adaptive immunization strategies considering viral mutations.

Public concerns largely revolved around COVID-19’s resurgence and the significant increase in cases posing a renewed stress on health systems. Other significant public health concerns included the persistent and alarming mortality rates from Rabies and TB despite established preventive measures and treatment protocols. These trends raised critical questions about healthcare access disparities and the effectiveness of public health strategies in targeted rural and hard-to-reach urban areas. Additionally, sporadic but deadly occurrences of diseases like Monkeypox and Plague indicated the need for vigilant surveillance and rapid response frameworks to counter potential outbreaks.

## Recommendations

Given the current epidemiological patterns, several recommendations are posited to address the challenges facing public health in mainland China. First, robust implementation and widespread dissemination of COVID-19 boosters, especially in areas witnessing case resurgences, can mitigate transmission. Continued public education campaigns are crucial to counter vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, ensuring high uptake rates across all age brackets. Health authorities should maintain comprehensive contact tracing and testing programs, particularly in regions with rising COVID-19 incidence.

Furthermore, the augmentation of vaccination programs for preventable diseases, particularly Influenza and Rabies, needs to be prioritized. Increased allocation of resources to ensure accessible vaccination routes and public awareness drives will be crucial in bolstering herd immunity and preventing fatalities, especially among vulnerable demographics. For Rabies, augmenting public health infrastructure to provide prompt post-exposure prophylaxis is essential, alongside sustained education on animal bite prevention.

Promoting adherence to TB treatment protocols, through community health worker engagement and digital adherence monitoring tools, can substantially decrease TB mortality rates. These programs should especially target high-prevalence districts with tailored interventions addressing socio-economic barriers impeding treatment continuity. A multi-faceted approach involving both pharmacological and educational support can dramatically reduce TB’s public health impact.

Finally, to combat pervasive health infrastructure disparities, sustained investment in rural and underserved areas is paramount. Strengthening surveillance systems through technological integration, enhanced training for medical professionals, and establishing rapid response teams for emerging infectious diseases will empower a more cohesive healthcare response. Emphasizing community-based health education can further amplify disease prevention and early detection efforts.

In summary, a strategic, multi-stakeholder approach incorporating robust public health policy, community engagement, and international collaboration will be crucial to effectively mitigate the morbidity and mortality impact of prevalent diseases and emerging health concerns in mainland China.
