## Introduction

## Overview

In November 2025, Chinese mainland witnessed variable patterns of disease prevalence across several notable infectious diseases, ranging from respiratory ailments to vector-borne diseases. Particularly noteworthy was the significant number of reported cases of influenza, infectious diarrhea, and hepatitis B. Influenza reported the highest case count with 8,563,582 cases, outpacing infectious diarrhea (7,635,536 cases) and hepatitis B (1,708,938 cases). The surge in influenza and infectious diarrhea cases could be attributed to seasonal changes, particularly the onset of winter which typically exacerbates influenza outbreaks. Meanwhile, hepatitis B remained a significant concern due to its chronic nature and implications for public health.

When examining mortality data, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) proved to be among the most lethal, with 1,528 deaths reported. While other diseases had high mortality counts, such as the 340 deaths attributed to tuberculosis, AIDS continues to pose a serious challenge despite advancements in treatment. Rabies reported a strikingly high mortality (100% fatality rate from 101 reported cases), highlighting ongoing concerns regarding animal control and public health awareness about rabies prophylaxis post-exposure. Although some diseases like polio, monkeypox, and scarlet fever accounted for fewer cases, their presence signifies the importance of vigilant epidemiological monitoring, given their potential for outbreaks.

## Concerns

Among high-incidence diseases is influenza, primarily due to its ability to spread rapidly, resulting in substantial morbidity and economic impacts due to missed work and school days. The persistence of hepatitis B further exasperates public health, as this chronic virus leads to liver dysfunction and elevated cancer risks. These diseases command urgent healthcare responses focused on vaccination initiatives and therapeutic interventions. Despite the decline in COVID-19 cases (2,265,742), post-pandemic vigilance is necessary to manage potential resurgences.

Public concern is amplified by diseases with high mortality rates, including rabies and AIDS. These diseases necessitate enhanced medical interventions and public health campaigns. The persistence of rabies fatalities underscores inadequate preventive strategies, advocating for widespread animal vaccination and public education. The sustained AIDS mortality rate illustrates persistent gaps in healthcare services, highlighting the need for comprehensive anti-retroviral programs, social services, and prevention initiatives. These diseases crucially impact China's healthcare strategy, warranting heightened international collaboration and research investments.

## Recommendations

Given the complexity and prevalence of infectious diseases in mainland China during November 2025, public health policies must be adjusted to prioritize preventive measures, treatment efficacy, and healthcare accessibility. To combat the influx of influenza cases, strategic vaccination drives are crucial, particularly expanding coverage to vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with comorbidities. Implementing educational campaigns can further reduce transmission by emphasizing hygiene practices and encouraging flu vaccination.

A robust approach toward hepatitis B entails an expansion of vaccination protocols and targeted screening programs to identify carriers and ensure early intervention. Public health campaigns need to stress the importance of vaccination for at-risk groups and reinforce safe practices among sexually active individuals. Healthcare providers should be equipped with the tools and training necessary to address the chronic nature of hepatitis B and provide sustainable patient management pathways.

To address rabies mortality, a concerted effort must be made toward animal control, including enhancing infrastructure for stray animal management and vaccination campaigns. Public educational outreach should concentrate on generating awareness concerning the lethal consequences of rabies and the critical importance of timely post-exposure prophylaxis. Strengthening veterinary human resources can facilitate the rapid identification and control of rabies outbreaks.

In tackling AIDS mortality, continued investment in antiretroviral therapies is required. It is crucial to enhance public health infrastructure to support AIDS patients, employing holistic approaches that consider mental health and social support systems. Collaborative research efforts aimed at advancing cure research and improving therapy effectiveness can create promising avenues for reducing the burden of AIDS.

Overall, an integrated public health strategy anchored in preventive vaccination, surveillance, and educational outreach is essential to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in China. Collaborative efforts across governmental and non-governmental sectors can amplify resources, ensuring sustainable progress in reducing disease prevalence and mortality. These interventions will not only enhance current healthcare responses but also bolster preparedness for future challenges. The focus should remain on strengthening local health systems, advancing public health research, and fostering community engagement to promote health resilience across the nation.
