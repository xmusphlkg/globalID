## Introduction

# Epidemiological Report: Prevalence and Impact of Diseases in the Chinese Mainland (March 2025)

## Overview

March 2025 has exhibited a mix of high-incidence diseases and those with significant morbidity and mortality within the Chinese mainland. Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) reported 5,295 cases with a staggering 2,068 deaths. This clearly highlights the dire health situation related to AIDS in China, as the high mortality rate signifies substantial public health challenges. Another drug-resistant respiratory ailment, tuberculosis, showed a notable increase with 49,068 cases and 161 deaths, emphasizing the persistent danger and need for more focused preventative measures.

On the other hand, infectious diarrhea saw high incidence numbers with 125,319 cases yet with notably lower death counts compared to the previous month. This presents a contrasting scenario but still stresses the importance of continued surveillance and hygiene initiatives to minimize outbreak risks. COVID-19's re-emergence with 1,730 cases and 442 deaths also highlights the ongoing burden of managing this pandemic, pushing forward the need for sustained vigilance and vaccination coverage.

## Concerns

Among the diseases of highest incidence, Hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD) showed a sharp spike with 43,084 cases compared to 4,842 from the previous month, though with relatively few deaths. HFMD primarily affects children and can cause severe complications; hence, it remains a significant public health concern. Hepatitis E also showcased a considerable surge, totaling 20,801 cases from 17,712 cases, though mortality is manageable with 167 deaths reported. These increases warrant attention to improved sanitation practices and better access to healthcare services.

Conversely, Monkeypox's classification moving to a class B infectious disease indicates an alarming rise in casesâ€”95 identified in March compared to an average of about 17 cases in preceding months. Despite a relatively low fatality rate, the spread of monkeypox presents a new challenge, requiring proactive health measures and public education. Regardless, the epidemiological data presents consistent public concern over AIDS, infectious diarrhea, and tuberculosis due to their significant morbidity patterns but will need continued monitoring and interventions.

## Recommendations

### For the Public:

1. **Strengthening Hygiene and Sanitation Measures:** Preventing infectious diarrhea and HFMD through regular hand washing, proper food handling, and maintaining clean environments can drastically reduce case numbers. Public health campaigns should emphasize these practices, particularly within families and healthcare settings.

2. **Increased Vaccination Uptake:** COVID-19 and hepatitis-laden cases show the critical need for widespread vaccination. Authorities should initiate booster campaigns for COVID-19 and improve outreach regarding hepatitis vaccinations to curb infections and fatalities.

3. **Awareness Programs:** With monkeypox reclassified to class B, public awareness must be increased about symptoms and transmission pathways. Similar efforts should be intensified for tuberculosis and AIDS, focusing on early detection and customized treatment plans.

### Institutional Recommendations:

1. **Healthcare Surveillance:** Rigorous tracking and reporting mechanisms must be enhanced for diseases like monkeypox and tuberculosis to ensure timely intervention. Upgradation of the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System could ensure better data precision and rapid response strategies.

2. **Research and Development:** Focused investments in R&D to develop better, cost-effective treatment and preventive measures for high-incidence diseases can create robust defense mechanisms within the public health landscape.

Lastly, collaboration efforts at local, regional, and national levels to ensure proper resource allocation, timely interventions, and maintaining steady communication with the public can steward better health outcomes within the Chinese mainland.

In conclusion, March 2025 portrays a critical period in managing diverse infectious diseases with dominant strains posing severe health challenges. Upgrading public health practices, fortifying healthcare infrastructure, and instituting well-coordinated surveillance coupled with community practices remain fundamental to mitigating the impact of these diseases.
