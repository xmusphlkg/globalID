## Introduction

## Overview

### Cases

In December 2025, the Chinese mainland observed continued high reporting of infectious diseases, with both common and emerging pathogens contributing to notable patterns. Respiratory illnesses dominated total notifications, highlighted by Influenza (with some months exceeding one million cases, e.g., November: 1,677,011; December: 427,083), a seasonal peak coinciding with colder weather and increased indoor congregation. Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) remained a major child health threat (December: 378,738 cases), emblematic of ongoing enterovirus transmission. Hepatitis (all types) together contributed to over 150,000 cases this month, with Hepatitis B and C remaining long-term endemic threats. Among diarrheal diseases, infectious diarrhea (excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid/paratyphoid) persisted at high levels, typically above 100,000 monthly cases, illustrating the burden of enteric diseases year-round.

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially syphilis (54,136 cases) and gonorrhea (10,003 cases), remained stably prevalent, with outbreaks partly compounded by increased mobility and testing. Tuberculosis, another chronic public health challenge, accounted for 52,826 reported cases. Notable, though smaller, numbers were reported for vector-borne diseases such as Brucellosis, Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever, and Japanese Encephalitis, with monthly totals ranging from hundreds to several thousands. HIV/AIDS continued to contribute steadily to the case load (AIDS: 3,749 cases), consistent with multi-year slow growth trends.

### Deaths

The spectrum of reported deaths reflected both the virulence of certain pathogens and gaps in early case detection. Tuberculosis consistently led mortality among Class B diseases, with 247 deaths in December, indicative of ongoing transmission and treatment challenges despite robust control programs. AIDS contributed 1,532 deaths, though this number reflects all-cause deaths among previously-diagnosed patients—not necessarily deaths solely attributable to HIV. Hepatitis, particularly hepatitis B and C, remained key contributors to chronic disease burden, with hepatitis B accounting for 42 deaths.

Seasonal influenza, while causing a vast number of cases, resulted in a relatively low death count (December: 0 deaths), suggesting effective medical management and/or underreporting of fatal outcomes given the sheer volume of cases. Fatalities from Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever (e.g., 0-26 deaths monthly), Rabies (monthly deaths ranged 4-29), and Japanese Encephalitis (up to 3 in some months) emphasize the ongoing importance of vector control and vaccination. Notably, fewer deaths were attributed to diarrheal diseases, scarlet fever, and vector-borne pathogens like malaria in this period, reflecting success in advanced diagnostics and early treatment.

## Concerns

### High Incidence Diseases

Influenza and HFMD present the highest incidence, fueling concern for both healthcare resource utilization and risk of severe outcomes in vulnerable populations. Influenza’s seasonal pattern is stark: November saw a major surge (up to 1.6 million cases) followed by a rapid decline in December (427,083 cases), illustrating responsiveness to weather and population dynamics. Hand, foot and mouth disease maintained high transmission (378,738 cases in December) with near-zero deaths, remarkable but indicating ongoing risks to pediatric populations. Infectious diarrhea maintained persistently high numbers, highlighting the ongoing presence of enteric pathogens and hygiene challenges.

Tuberculosis and hepatitis B (and C) show continued high burden—critical for long-term morbidity as complications accumulate even when short-term deaths are relatively low. STIs such as syphilis (54,136 cases) and gonorrhea (10,003 cases) also require dedicated attention for both prevention and follow-up, as they can facilitate coinfection and long-term sequelae, particularly if antimicrobial resistance increases.

### Diseases of Public Concern, Mortality, and Significant Trends

Despite high case numbers, some diseases have outsized public attention due to mortality risk, potential for outbreaks, or changes in notification rates. November–December saw a dramatic spike in COVID-19 cases preceding December (e.g., November: 62,723 cases, December: 18,704 cases), with corresponding mortality, reflecting potential new variant introductions or increased testing—especially given global circulation and winter spread. Rabies, though low in incidence (28 cases, 30 deaths in December), continues to evoke public anxiety due to its near-universal fatality rate, highlighting the consequences of gaps in prophylaxis and stray animal management.

Epidemic Hemorrhagic Fever and Brucellosis, while not at record peak, showed variability in deaths and cases (EHF up to 26 deaths in December, Brucellosis steady at ~6,000), deserving monitoring for possible outbreak signals in specific areas. Similarly, the emergence of Monkeypox as a notifiable disease since late 2023 places added emphasis on early detection and containment, although exact December data was not available. Notable, too, are isolated spikes in deaths—such as hepatitis C (545 deaths in December), suggesting regional outbreaks, late diagnosis, or reporting artifacts needing urgent clarification.

## Recommendations

### Community-Level Interventions

For the public, enhancing community-level hygiene practices remains critical. Given continued high transmission of enteric diseases and HFMD, frequent handwashing—especially in schools and childcare settings—and food safety awareness should be rigorously promoted. Families should remain vigilant for respiratory symptoms during peak influenza months and seek early medical advice for vulnerable groups such as young children, elderly, and those with chronic disease. Vaccination programs for influenza and HFMD, where licensed and recommended, should be supported by public education and access initiatives, particularly before winter peaks.

Sexually transmitted diseases persist as a major concern. Public campaigns encouraging routine testing, condom usage, and destigmatization of STI/HIV screening will be key for early case detection and transmission interruption. Community outreach should particularly target migrant populations and young adults, coupled with reliable information about antimicrobial resistance risks.

### Medical System Response

Healthcare facilities must maintain robust stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics to manage predictable peaks in respiratory, enteric, and vector-borne diseases. Early diagnostic capabilities—involving rapid tests for influenza, COVID-19, and enteric pathogens—should be cost-accessible and widely distributed, especially in rural and peri-urban settings. Tuberculosis and hepatitis B/C programs need persistent reinforcement: ensure patient follow-up, medication adherence, and active case finding, especially in high-burden regions.

Expanded training for health providers in recognizing rare but fatal diseases (e.g., rabies, Japanese encephalitis, epidemic hemorrhagic fever) could prevent missed diagnosis and facilitate timely intervention. Vector control measures—such as regular spraying and environmental management for mosquitoes and rodents—must remain routine, given the ever-present risk of outbreaks.

### Surveillance and Data Transparency

The significant variability and occasional spikes in deaths from hepatitis C, rabies, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever suggest the need for ongoing real-time surveillance, with automatic flagging of aberrant trends. Authorities should clarify data anomalies quickly and communicate effectively with local CDCs, ensuring root causes (outbreaks, late reporting, data errors) are rapidly addressed. Promoting transparent, timely public reporting—especially for atypical clusters such as COVID-19 surges or new pathogen emergence (e.g., Monkeypox)—will preserve public trust and expedite containment.

In summary, while many infectious diseases in Chinese mainland remain stably endemic and are managed by mature systems, ongoing vigilance toward seasonal peaks, emergent threats, and residual high-mortality pathogens is vital. Public adherence to hygiene, vaccination, responsible sexual behavior, and timely healthcare access will minimize overall burden. Continued surveillance, expanded vaccination, and health education will best position communities to withstand recurring and new infectious disease threats.
