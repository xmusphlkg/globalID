## Introduction

## Overview

In June 2024, the Chinese mainland witnessed significant fluctuations in the prevalence and mortality of various diseases. The overall disease burden, as reported, includes a wide range of conditions from infectious diseases to chronic illnesses, with notable increases in certain areas. The total number of reported cases for the month was dominated by infectious diseases, with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) recording the highest incidence at 193,230 cases, followed by infectious diarrhea and influenza. Notably, the number of cases for these diseases often exceeded 100,000, highlighting their substantial public health impact.

Mortality data revealed a mixed pattern, with some diseases showing particularly high death rates despite lower incidence rates. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) reported the highest number of deaths at 1,726, reflecting ongoing challenges in managing chronic infectious diseases. Influenza, despite a high number of cases, had a relatively low mortality rate with 16 deaths, indicating effective treatment and prevention strategies. However, diseases like rabies, though fewer in cases (42 reported cases), had a notably high fatality rate, contributing to 37 deaths. This highlights the need for continued public health vigilance and vaccination efforts.

## Concerns

The high incidence of HFMD, infectious diarrhea, and influenza represents a significant public health concern. HFMD, with nearly 200,000 cases, poses substantial risks, especially to young children. The widespread nature of these infections underscores the need for improved public health strategies, including better hygiene practices and public education campaigns to curb transmission.

Public concern has also been heightened by diseases with lower incidence but high mortality or severe complications. Rabies, for instance, continues to be a critical issue due to its near-universal fatality rate once symptoms appear. Despite relatively low case numbers, the high death toll signifies gaps in pre-exposure prophylaxis and post-exposure treatment. Similarly, diseases like dengue fever, although not as widespread, pose severe health risks and have the potential to lead to outbreaks, especially in regions with conducive environmental conditions for mosquito breeding.

## Recommendations

### Enhancing Surveillance and Reporting

Strengthening disease surveillance and reporting systems is crucial. This includes not only improving the accuracy of case detection and reporting but also ensuring timely updates and public notifications. Enhanced surveillance will help in early detection and prompt response to outbreaks, reducing the overall disease burden.

### Public Health Education and Vaccination Campaigns

Public education campaigns are vital to raising awareness about preventive measures, especially for diseases like HFMD, influenza, and infectious diarrhea. Emphasizing hand hygiene, safe food and water practices, and respiratory etiquette can significantly reduce transmission. Vaccination campaigns should be bolstered, particularly for influenza, to minimize seasonal outbreaks. Rabies vaccination for pets and post-exposure prophylaxis for humans should be prioritized to prevent fatalities.

### Vector Control and Environmental Management

For vector-borne diseases like dengue, vector control measures are essential. Public health authorities should implement strategies to reduce mosquito populations, such as eliminating standing water and using insecticides in high-risk areas. Public education on avoiding mosquito bites and recognizing early symptoms can also help reduce the incidence and severity of these diseases.

### Strengthening Healthcare Systems and Accessibility

Improving healthcare infrastructure and accessibility is critical to managing disease outbreaks and reducing mortality. This includes ensuring that healthcare facilities are equipped to handle sudden surges in patient numbers, especially during outbreaks of diseases like influenza and dengue. Access to antiretroviral therapy for AIDS patients and rabies immunoglobulin for post-exposure treatment should be guaranteed across all regions.

### Research and Development

Investing in research and development is essential for better understanding and controlling diseases. This includes developing new vaccines, improving existing ones, and researching novel therapeutic approaches. Collaboration with international health organizations can enhance these efforts and facilitate the adoption of best practices.

### Conclusion

The epidemiological landscape of the Chinese mainland in June 2024 underscores the ongoing challenges in managing infectious diseases. While significant progress has been made in controlling some conditions, others continue to pose serious public health threats. By implementing comprehensive public health strategies, including improved surveillance, public education, and healthcare system strengthening, the burden of disease can be significantly reduced. Continued vigilance and proactive measures will be essential in ensuring the health and well-being of the population.
