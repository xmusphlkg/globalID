## Introduction

## Overview

As of June 2025, the Chinese mainland continues to encounter a varied spectrum of diseases with differing levels of incidence and mortality. Notable diseases by case count include infectious diarrhea with 290,010 reported cases, hepatitis B with 140,045 cases, and tuberculosis with approximately 72,928 cases. Dengue fever reported a significant tally of 13,873 cases, primarily confined to southern regions. Infectious diarrhea showed an unusual surge this month, rising to 290,010 incidences, reflecting potential underlying environmental or sanitary challenges.

The mortality landscape presents a critical concern, with notable fatalities attributed to AIDS (totaling 7,490 deaths) and hepatitis B (with 274 deaths). In terms of specific outbreaks, COVID-19 deaths were recorded at 227,604, while rabies accounted for 227 cases throughout the month. This signifies a notable elevation in fatalities when compared to previous months, suggesting possible lapses in treatment efficacy or public health response. The high AIDS mortality starkly contrasts with the relatively lower death toll from diseases like dengue, indicating an urgent need for targeted interventions in combating chronic lifelong infections.

## Concerns

The prevalent high incidence diseases include infectious diarrhea, hepatitis B, and tuberculosis. Of particular concern is infectious diarrhea, showing a marked increase from earlier months. This could be indicative of lapses in sanitation or water quality, warranting detailed investigation into environmental and health system factors. The continued high incidence of hepatitis B suggests that despite ongoing national vaccination campaigns, transmission remains significant, potentially due to cultural practices or gaps in healthcare delivery.

Public concern in June 2025 has been prominently focused on the COVID-19 resurgence, underscored by the staggering mortality of 227,604 cases. While the number of reported cases is comparably lower than earlier peaks, the fatalities highlight a critical health infrastructure strain or possibly the emergence of more virulent strains. Public dialogues have also featured discussions about the persistent incidence of malaria and its potential resurgence due to increasing global travel and climate factors affecting vector habitats.

## Recommendations

To address these pressing concerns, it is paramount that public health initiatives in China for June 2025 prioritize strengthening infection prevention and control measures, particularly for high-incidence diseases like infectious diarrhea and hepatitis B. Public awareness campaigns should emphasize hygiene, safe food and water practices, and vaccination benefits. Adapting public health systems to provide early interventions and routinely evaluating sanitation infrastructure are critical steps.

Given the COVID-19 resurgence, reinstating targeted public health interventions, such as scalable testing and contact tracing initiatives, is essential. Moreover, it is recommended that the government intensify vaccination efforts, especially for high-risk populations, to curb mortality rates. There should be a concerted effort to augment healthcare resource allocation to cope with hospital admissions due to COVID-19, possibly through international collaboration for knowledge and resource sharing.

Finally, combating the long-tenured threat of AIDS and rabies requires nuanced approaches. Enhancing access to antiretroviral therapies and post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies should be practical priorities. Community-based health education workshops can play a significant role in disseminating crucial knowledge on HIV prevention and rabies vaccination campaigns, decisively addressing stigmas and misinformation surrounding these diseases.
