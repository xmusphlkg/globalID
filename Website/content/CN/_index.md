## Introduction

## Overview

In August 2024, China reported significant numbers of cases for various infectious diseases, reflecting ongoing public health challenges across different regions. Among the high-incidence diseases were infectious diarrhea, influenza, hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD), and hepatitis. A total of 127,630 cases of infectious diarrhea, 516,676 cases of influenza, and 193,230 cases of HFMD were recorded, emphasizing the importance of these conditions to the national disease control agenda. Additionally, hepatitis continued to contribute significantly to the disease burden, particularly hepatitis B, with 106,985 cases reported. Diseases with high incidence often involve respiratory or gastrointestinal transmission routes, requiring continued monitoring and prevention strategies to limit spread.

On the mortality side, tuberculosis led to the highest number of deaths, with 179 deaths out of 84,304 cases, followed closely by AIDS-related deaths at 1,726, highlighting the severe impact of these chronic infections. While infections like influenza had high case counts, they led to relatively fewer deaths (16), reflecting the effectiveness of interventions or lower disease severity for most cases. However, diseases like rabies, although less common (42 cases), had a high case-fatality ratio, accounting for 37 deaths, marking it as a public health concern with fatal outcomes.

## Concerns

### High-Incidence Diseases

In August 2024, HFMD remained one of the most prevalent diseases, with over 193,000 cases reported. This viral infection is most common among young children and can spread rapidly in childcare settings, particularly in densely populated areas. Though most cases are mild, complications like viral meningitis or encephalitis can occur, requiring hospitalization. The prevalence of infectious diarrhea (127,630 cases) also raised concerns, especially given its potential for widespread transmission through contaminated food or water. This high incidence highlights the need for robust sanitation measures and public awareness campaigns around hygiene practices.

Hepatitis B continues to be a significant health issue in China, with 106,985 cases reported in August. Despite public health efforts to reduce its spread through vaccination programs, the high number of cases points to challenges in managing chronic infections and preventing transmission. Hepatitis C also accounted for 23,334 cases, which, while lower than hepatitis B, requires attention due to its chronic nature and potential for long-term liver damage, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.

### Public Concerns

Although diseases like HFMD and infectious diarrhea have high incidence rates, public concern often centers around infections with severe outcomes, such as rabies and epidemic hemorrhagic fever (EHF). Despite only 42 rabies cases, the infection claimed 37 lives, maintaining its reputation as one of the deadliest infections once symptoms develop. Rabies, primarily transmitted through animal bites, underscores the need for enhanced vaccination programs for pets and timely post-exposure prophylaxis for humans. Similarly, EHF, though reporting only 411 cases, resulted in 13 deaths, indicating a serious risk of mortality once contracted. Public awareness and vector control efforts remain crucial in preventing these zoonotic diseases.

Emerging diseases like dengue (6,120 cases) also garnered public attention, particularly with global warming and increased travel contributing to the spread of vector-borne diseases. While dengue is not endemic in all regions of China, outbreaks have been observed in southern provinces, and continued vigilance is necessary to prevent its further spread. In addition, although COVID-19 cases were not reported in the provided data, residual concerns about its resurgence continue to influence public health discourse, underscoring the need for maintaining readiness for potential new outbreaks.

## Recommendations

### Strengthening Disease Surveillance and Reporting

To combat the spread of highly infectious diseases, continued investment in disease surveillance systems is essential. Expanding the reach and capacity of the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System (NNDRS) will allow for more rapid identification of outbreaks and implementation of control measures. Local health authorities should enhance coordination with hospitals and clinics to ensure timely reporting and verification of cases. This would be particularly important for diseases such as rabies, EHF, and dengue, where early intervention can significantly reduce mortality.

Furthermore, implementing real-time data sharing between provinces could facilitate quicker responses to emerging outbreaks, especially for diseases like dengue that can spread rapidly due to favorable environmental conditions. Strengthening diagnostic capabilities at the local level will also aid in identifying and managing cases more effectively, especially for diseases like hepatitis B and C, which require long-term management.

### Public Health Education and Awareness

Raising public awareness through education campaigns can significantly reduce the transmission of high-incidence diseases like HFMD, infectious diarrhea, and hepatitis. Educational programs should focus on promoting good hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing, safe food handling, and ensuring proper sanitation facilities. In the case of HFMD, awareness programs targeting childcare centers and schools can help limit the spread of the virus by encouraging early recognition of symptoms and preventing infected children from attending school.

Public health campaigns should also emphasize the importance of timely vaccinations, particularly for hepatitis B, where neonatal vaccination is highly effective in preventing the disease. For diseases like rabies, public education on avoiding stray animals, vaccinating pets, and seeking post-exposure prophylaxis can save lives. Since the fatality rate of rabies is near 100% after symptom onset, preventive measures and awareness about seeking immediate treatment after exposure are critical.

### Vector Control and Environmental Measures

Given the rise in vector-borne diseases like dengue, implementing strong vector control measures is critical. This includes targeted insecticide spraying in high-risk areas, eliminating mosquito breeding sites, and encouraging the use of protective measures, such as bed nets and insect repellent. Local governments should collaborate with environmental agencies to monitor and reduce the habitats that allow mosquitoes to thrive, particularly in urban areas where population density can exacerbate the spread of disease.

In rural areas, efforts should focus on improving sanitation and access to clean water to reduce the incidence of diseases like infectious diarrhea and cholera. Investments in public infrastructure, such as waste disposal systems and safe drinking water, will go a long way in reducing the burden of waterborne diseases. Moreover, providing training and resources to rural health workers will ensure that early detection and response to outbreaks are possible, minimizing the overall public health impact.

### Vaccination and Immunization Campaigns

Vaccination remains one of the most effective tools in preventing infectious diseases. In August 2024, the continued high number of hepatitis B cases despite vaccination programs highlights gaps in coverage, especially in rural areas. Strengthening these programs through targeted vaccination drives and ensuring access to vaccines in remote regions can help reduce the incidence of hepatitis and other preventable diseases. Expanded immunization campaigns should also focus on diseases like Japanese encephalitis and diphtheria, which have the potential to cause severe illness in unvaccinated populations.

For rabies prevention, ensuring that the animal population is adequately vaccinated is crucial. Veterinary services must be equipped to provide widespread vaccination for domestic animals, particularly in areas where human-rabies interaction is more likely. Education campaigns targeting pet owners and communities with high animal populations can reduce the number of animal-to-human transmissions.

In conclusion, while China has made significant progress in controlling many infectious diseases, August 2024 saw continued challenges with high-incidence conditions like HFMD, hepatitis, and infectious diarrhea. Public health authorities should focus on strengthening disease surveillance, improving public education, enhancing vector control, and expanding vaccination programs to mitigate these risks and protect public health.
