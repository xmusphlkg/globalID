## Introduction

## Overview

In February 2025, the Chinese mainland reported a diverse array of infectious diseases, with significant variations in both incidence and mortality rates. The total number of cases for the month was dominated by hepatitis, influenza, and infectious diarrhea, which collectively accounted for a substantial portion of the reported cases. Hepatitis, particularly Hepatitis B, was the most prevalent, with over 140,000 cases reported. Influenza also saw a high incidence, with over 1.6 million cases, reflecting the seasonal nature of the disease. Infectious diarrhea, excluding cholera, dysentery, typhoid fever, and paratyphoid fever, was another major contributor, with over 1.2 million cases reported.

In terms of mortality, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and COVID-19 were the leading causes of death among the infectious diseases reported. AIDS accounted for 1,777 deaths, while COVID-19, despite a lower number of cases compared to other diseases, resulted in 2,611 deaths. This highlights the high mortality rate associated with these diseases. Other diseases with notable mortality rates included rabies, with 15 deaths, and epidemic hemorrhagic fever, which caused 26 deaths. The data underscores the ongoing public health challenges posed by both chronic and emerging infectious diseases in the region.

## Concerns

The high incidence of hepatitis, particularly Hepatitis B, remains a significant public health concern in China. With over 140,000 cases reported in February alone, it underscores the need for continued vaccination efforts and public health campaigns to reduce transmission. The high prevalence of Hepatitis B is a reflection of both historical and ongoing transmission, necessitating a comprehensive approach that includes vaccination, public education, and improved access to healthcare services. Influenza, with its seasonal peaks, also poses a significant challenge, particularly in terms of healthcare system burden and the need for effective vaccination strategies.

Public concern is also heightened by the significant number of deaths associated with COVID-19 and AIDS. Despite the availability of vaccines and treatments, COVID-19 continues to pose a threat, particularly with the emergence of new variants. The high mortality rate associated with AIDS highlights the need for continued efforts in prevention, early diagnosis, and treatment. Additionally, the emergence of diseases such as epidemic hemorrhagic fever, which caused 26 deaths, and the ongoing threat of rabies, with 15 deaths, underscore the need for vigilance and preparedness in addressing both endemic and emerging infectious diseases.

## Recommendations

To address the high incidence of hepatitis, particularly Hepatitis B, it is crucial to enhance vaccination coverage, especially among high-risk populations. Public health campaigns should focus on increasing awareness about the importance of vaccination and the availability of treatment options. Additionally, efforts should be made to improve access to healthcare services, particularly in rural and underserved areas, to ensure timely diagnosis and treatment.

For influenza, it is essential to strengthen vaccination campaigns, particularly targeting vulnerable populations such as the elderly, young children, and individuals with underlying health conditions. Public health authorities should also focus on improving surveillance systems to detect and respond to outbreaks promptly. Encouraging good hygiene practices, such as regular handwashing and the use of masks during peak seasons, can also help reduce transmission.

In addressing the ongoing threat of COVID-19, it is important to continue promoting vaccination and booster campaigns, particularly in light of emerging variants. Public health messaging should emphasize the importance of vaccination in reducing severe outcomes and mortality. Additionally, efforts should be made to enhance healthcare system capacity to manage potential surges in cases, including ensuring adequate supplies of personal protective equipment and critical care resources.

Finally, to address the high mortality rates associated with diseases such as AIDS and rabies, it is crucial to enhance prevention and treatment efforts. For AIDS, this includes increasing access to antiretroviral therapy and promoting safe practices to reduce transmission. For rabies, efforts should focus on increasing vaccination coverage for both humans and animals, as well as improving access to post-exposure prophylaxis. Public health authorities should also prioritize education and awareness campaigns to reduce the risk of exposure and improve early detection and treatment outcomes.
