# Introduction

## Overview

The Chinese mainland faced a diverse epidemiological landscape in July 2024, marked by significant disease occurrences and public health challenges. Notably, the incidence of diseases such as Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis remained pronounced. Specifically, Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease reported the highest case number at 188,477, followed by Hepatitis with 123,561 cases and Tuberculosis with 80,973 cases. Among the health concerns, the alarming rate of increase in the cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and vector-borne diseases highlighted ongoing public health challenges. Hepatitis B and C collectively reported over 131,319 cases indicating a pressing concern for liver-related infections. The mortality associated with various diseases did not significantly deviate from patterns observed in previous months. However, the incidence of deaths attributed to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) marked 1,732 out of the total 6,435 reported cases, reflecting a considerable mortality rate and underlining the critical impact of chronic infectious diseases on the public health system.

The month of July also witnessed a concerning rise in cases related to Infectious Diarrhea and Influenza, with 106,258 and 46,048 cases respectively, hinting at an urgent need for enhanced surveillance and preventive measures. Moreover, despite a relatively lower fatality rate, the sheer volume of communicable diseases such as Acute Hemorrhagic Conjunctivitis, with 3,518 reported cases, and the emergent vector-borne diseases underscore the variability and the dynamic nature of public health threats facing the Chinese mainland. It's noteworthy that the data reflects both clinically-diagnosed and laboratory-confirmed cases across the 31 provincial-level administrative divisions in the Chinese mainland, emphasizing a comprehensive overview of the nation's current epidemiological status.

## Concerns

July 2024 brought to light issues surrounding diseases with high incidence alongside those that sparked public concern due to their heightened presence and potential for widespread impact. Diseases like Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease took precedence with an astonishing 188,477 reported cases, indicating an urgent need for targeted public health interventions and awareness campaigns, especially among children who are most at risk. Similarly, the hepatitis cluster, predominantly Hepatitis B with 110,385 cases and Hepatitis C with 22,613 cases, presents a significant burden of liver diseases, suggesting a potential loophole in the prevention and control measures against blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections.

Public concern notably heightened around the resurgence of Influenza and Infectious Diarrhea cases. The astronomical rise to 4,113,326 reported cases of Influenza from the previous months positioned it as a notable threat, potentially signaling the onset of an epidemic if not promptly addressed. Furthermore, the widespread instances of Infectious Diarrhea, excluding other gastrointestinal infections like cholera and dysentery, amplified concerns about water and food safety standards, hygiene practices, and the need for public education on preventive measures to curb its transmission.

## Recommendations

In light of the prevailing disease incidences and the emerging public health concerns, it is imperative to strategize on multipronged intervention measures aimed at controlling and preventing further spread. First, thereâ€™s a critical need for bolstering public health awareness campaigns focused on hygiene practices, especially handwashing with soap and safe water usage, to mitigate the spread of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Infectious Diarrhea. Tailored messages should aim at schools and child care centers to educate both the staff and the families about the symptoms, modes of transmission, and preventive strategies against these infections.

Secondly, enhancing vaccination efforts against Hepatitis B and incorporating routine screenings for Hepatitis C in high-risk populations can significantly reduce the disease burden. As sexual transmission remains a key concern, comprehensive sexual health education and services, including access to contraceptives and safe sex practices, are essential.

Lastly, in response to the dramatic increase in Influenza cases, it is crucial to advocate for annual flu vaccinations, especially for vulnerable populations such as the elderly, pregnant women, and individuals with chronic diseases. Public health responses should also stress the importance of seeking medical advice for flu-like symptoms to enable early detection and treatment, thereby minimizing the risk of severe complications.

The epidemiological data from July 2024 underscores the ever-evolving nature of public health challenges in the Chinese mainland. A collaborative effort encompassing governmental support, community engagement, and individual responsibility is paramount to navigate and mitigate the impacts of these diseases effectively.
