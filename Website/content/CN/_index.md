## Introduction

## Overview
In the specified period of May 2024, numerous infectious diseases have been reported in mainland China with considerable prevalence and impact. Among them, Hand Foot and Mouth Disease (HFMD) had the highest incidence with 193230 cases followed by other common diseases such as Hepatitis, Infectious Diarrhea, Syphilis, and Tuberculosis. The reported incidences of these diseases were 135827, 127630, 84304, and 54217 cases respectively. However, the mortality rate is meager in these diseases with just two deaths in HFMD, three in Infectious Diarrhea, 179 in Syphilis and three in Tuberculosis.

In terms of mortality, Hepatitis showed the maximum number of deaths among all reported diseases in the same period. It has 53 deaths followed by Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C having 40 and 13 deaths respectively. The overall high mortality rate was also seen in Rabies with 37 reported deaths out of 42 reported cases, reflecting a high death-to-case ratio. Another disease of concern is Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) with 1726 deaths despite a relatively low incidence. It is important to note that for AIDS the number of deaths represents all-cause mortality reported in the month by cumulative reported AIDS patients.

## Concerns 
High incidence diseases such as HFMD, Hepatitis, Infectious Diarrhea, Syphilis and Tuberculosis demand significant attention due to their widespread prevalence. These diseases not only strain the healthcare system due to their high frequency, but they also have the potential to create public panic during outbreaks, consequently impacting social and economic aspects of the society. HFMD particularly stands out due to its remarkably high occurrence.

Furthermore, although the public concern generally revolves around high incidence diseases, diseases with notably high mortality rates should not be overlooked. While AIDS, Hepatitis and Rabies have comparatively lower frequency, the risk they carry in terms of mortality is significant. This is especially true for Rabies and AIDS, where the high number of recorded deaths in contrast to the lower number of reported cases presents a serious public health concern.

## Recommendations 
For high incidence diseases like HFMD and Hepatitis, it is recommended that the public adhere to strict hygiene practices. Regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sick individuals, and maintaining clean environments can significantly prevent the spread of such diseases. Health authorities should make continued efforts to educate the public about these preventative measures and ensure vaccination policies are followed strictly, especially for Hepatitis. 

It is also important to encourage regular medical check-ups and prompt treatment seeking behavior among the public to manage these diseases effectively. Intervention programs that facilitate easy access to healthcare services can greatly contribute to this.

For high mortality diseases like AIDS and Rabies, efforts should be focused on early detection and timely treatment. Safe sex education and promoting the usage of condoms can help prevent the transmission of AIDS. For Rabies, public awareness about immediate treatment post-exposure and the significance of pet vaccination can aid in reducing the risk and mortality. 

In general, health authorities should prioritize strengthening disease surveillance systems and conduct regular epidemiological investigations to identify hotspots and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions. Public health policies should continue to adapt based on the changing dynamics of disease prevalence and public health concerns.
