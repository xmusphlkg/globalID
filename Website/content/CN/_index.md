## Introduction

## Overview

In October 2025, the Chinese mainland documented an extensive array of infectious diseases, demonstrating a dynamic epidemiological landscape. This period was marked by a varying degree of morbidity across different diseases. Significant attention was drawn to the staggering number of COVID-19 cases, which surged to an alarming 440,662 cases, despite a relatively low mortality rate of 7 deaths. Furthermore, infectious diarrhea cases topped the chart, with 227,604 reported cases. Hepatitis B and C also exhibited high prevalence, with 137,442 and 17,894 cases respectively. Hand, foot, and mouth disease was prevalent with 103,195 cases, showing its endemic nature. Influenza reported 1,655,264 cases, underscoring its high transmissibility. These counts are reflective of persistent challenges in managing and controlling infections in a densely populated setting like China.

The mortality statistics for October 2025 present a nuanced picture of healthcare vulnerabilities. While COVID-19 cases were widespread, the death toll was remarkably low. In contrast, diseases such as AIDS contributed significantly to mortality rates, with 331 deaths accounting for various causes among AIDS-diagnosed individuals. Hepatitis C and E demonstrated substantial mortality burdens, with 78 and 3 deaths, respectively. Influenza, despite its high case count, resulted in lower documented deaths. Moreover, diseases like Japanese encephalitis, despite having fewer cases, exhibited a high mortality rate with 37 fatalities, highlighting their severe impact when they do occur.

## Concerns

Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis topped the charts in terms of incidence among prominent diseases, recording an astounding 231,111 cases. Although typically self-limiting, the high transmission rate stressed the importance of preemptive measures in communal settings. Another alarming increase was observed for hand, foot, and mouth disease, recording 103,195 cases. Pertinent to these infectious concerns is the annual occurrence of cholera cases, which historically remains low but demands vigilance due to its potential for rapid, explosive outbreaks. These infectious agents underline the persistent challenges within public health systems, emphasizing the complex interplay of epidemiological factors that necessitate tailored intervention strategies.

Public concern has risen around the sharp increase in hepatitis cases, particularly hepatitis B and C. The vast number of hepatitis B cases, at 137,442, requires continued scrutiny to prevent further spread. Hepatitis C accounted for 17,894 cases, with its chronic nature posing long-term health challenges, including a progression to liver cirrhosis or cancer. The growing attention to these diseases signals a broader awareness and demand for healthcare resources to limit transmission and provide long-term care for affected individuals. Addressing this requires concerted efforts to improve vaccine coverage, provide antiviral therapies, and conduct public health campaigns advocating personal preventive measures.

## Recommendations

Given the intricate patterns of disease prevalence and public health concerns observed in October 2025, a multi-faceted approach is imperative to mitigate risks while enhancing health outcomes. Firstly, amplifying public health education is crucial. Authorities should adopt tailored communication strategies to raise awareness about prevailing diseases and empower citizens with knowledge to reduce exposure risks effectively. Recognizing cultural diversity across regions, campaigns should be linguistically and culturally adaptable to ensure wide reach and higher retention rates among diverse populations.

Secondly, reinforcement of vaccination campaigns is vital to curb the spread of highly transmissible diseases like influenza, hepatitis, and COVID-19. Health authorities should aim to improve vaccine accessibility and coverage, especially in rural and underserved areas, ensuring equitable healthcare delivery. Leveraging digital health tools can expedite the rollout of vaccination drives while maintaining comprehensive records to monitor vaccine uptake and efficacy. Additionally, inoculating high-risk groups, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions, should remain a priority to minimize health disparagement.

Finally, bolstering surveillance systems is indispensable to detect, monitor, and respond rapidly to evolving disease trends. Implementing real-time data analytics and enhancing the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System can empower healthcare administrators with timely insights into emerging threats, enabling preemptive policy actions. Collaborating with international health bodies will foster knowledge exchange, amplify resource pools, and facilitate coordinated responses to transboundary health crises. Ultimately, enhancing public trust in health systems is pivotal. Transparent communication, accountability, and adaptive policy frameworks are critical to forging resilient health infrastructures capable of withstanding future epidemiological challenges in China.
