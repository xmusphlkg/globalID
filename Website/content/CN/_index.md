## Introduction

## Overview

### Cases
In November 2024, the epidemiological landscape in mainland China has shown a mixed pattern of both endemic and emerging diseases, with varying degrees of severity across different regions. A total of 1,053,011 cases were reported across various diseases, with notable increases in the incidence of infectious diarrhea (122,103 cases), hand-foot-and-mouth disease (100,161 cases), and hepatitis (including Hepatitis B and C). Diseases like malaria, dengue, and tuberculosis remain persistent challenges, albeit with fewer reported cases than other diseases. Of particular concern are hepatitis B and C, which together accounted for over 104,000 cases, reflecting a continuous burden on public health systems. Meanwhile, diseases such as cholera, plague, and Ebola-like diseases remain negligible in numbers, with minimal impact compared to more prevalent infections. 

The geographical distribution of these diseases is heavily skewed towards urban and semi-urban centers, with provinces like Guangdong and Sichuan showing spikes in viral infections, including influenza, dengue, and hepatitis. The healthcare system, however, remains under pressure, especially in handling seasonal outbreaks, such as the high incidence of influenza (nearly 1.2 million cases) and hand-foot-and-mouth disease, which are particularly prevalent in pediatric populations. Furthermore, the national healthcare infrastructure is increasingly burdened by the rise in non-communicable diseases, although the focus of the epidemiological surveillance system remains firmly on infectious diseases.

### Deaths
As for mortality, a total of 658 deaths were reported in November 2024. The leading causes of death stemmed from diseases like tuberculosis (171 deaths), hepatitis-related complications (137 deaths), and the aftermath of influenza (55 deaths). A significant surge in fatalities was observed in dengue fever (with 16 deaths), which underscores the potential risks of vector-borne diseases, particularly in warmer, tropical climates where such diseases flourish. Hepatitis B and C continue to pose long-term mortality risks, as chronic infections often lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, explaining the high fatality rates associated with these diseases.

A noteworthy point in Novemberâ€™s mortality data is the reported deaths from emerging or less common diseases, such as monkeypox (2 deaths) and human infections with the H7N9 virus (1 death). Despite being rare, these diseases highlight the unpredictable nature of viral diseases and the importance of maintaining vigilant surveillance for zoonotic infections. The sharp rise in mortality linked to seasonal diseases such as influenza indicates a need for better seasonal preparedness and more robust vaccination coverage to mitigate the impact during flu season. 

## Concerns

### High Incidence Disease
Among the diseases with the highest incidence, influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease remain the most prevalent, with over 1.1 million and 100,000 reported cases, respectively. Influenza continues to be a significant seasonal threat, and the emergence of new flu strains contributes to the volatility in case numbers. In particular, the combination of viral and bacterial infections that often accompany influenza makes it difficult to manage within a strained healthcare system. Infections like pneumonia, which are often secondary to the flu, contribute to increased mortality among vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly and children. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease, primarily affecting children under five years old, has seen a notable uptick, creating a potential burden on hospitals and pediatric care units.

Additionally, the incidence of hepatitis B and C is of concern, given their chronic nature and the long-term public health impact. With over 100,000 reported cases, hepatitis is a leading cause of morbidity, contributing to cirrhosis and liver cancer. The high rate of undiagnosed cases and the slow progression of the disease are factors that make hepatitis an ongoing challenge, particularly since vaccination rates for hepatitis B, though improving, are still insufficient in some regions.

### Public Concern
Public concern is focused on diseases that have either high visibility in the media or pose substantial long-term health risks. These include hepatitis, tuberculosis, and seasonal viral diseases like influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The significant increase in hand-foot-and-mouth disease cases has raised concerns among parents and public health officials, as outbreaks in schools and daycare centers can spread rapidly. Similarly, the rise in influenza cases in conjunction with ongoing tuberculosis outbreaks has led to widespread public anxiety, with many fearing an overload of healthcare facilities.

Of particular concern is hepatitis B and C, which continue to receive significant attention from the public due to the chronic health complications associated with these infections. The increasing rates of hepatitis-related deaths and the lack of awareness about the long-term implications of these diseases, including the risks of cirrhosis and liver cancer, make it a critical area of concern. Public health campaigns, although improving, need to emphasize both prevention through vaccination and early detection through routine screening. With over 100,000 cases reported in November, these diseases are significant drivers of public health anxiety, and their impact on life expectancy and quality of life remains high.

## Recommendations

### Public Health Interventions
To mitigate the ongoing and rising incidences of preventable diseases, such as influenza, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and hepatitis, several public health interventions are recommended. Firstly, there needs to be an accelerated rollout of vaccination programs targeting influenza and hepatitis B. This should be complemented by robust public education campaigns to increase awareness about the availability of vaccines and the benefits of early vaccination. Special attention should be given to vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. Ensuring that healthcare providers have adequate resources to deal with an influx of seasonal infections is crucial to maintaining healthcare system functionality during peak seasons.

In addition, a targeted approach to reducing hepatitis B and C transmission should include expanded access to screening and treatment, especially for high-risk groups such as intravenous drug users, healthcare workers, and individuals with a history of blood transfusions. Emphasizing the role of early detection and antiviral treatments could prevent a significant number of cases from progressing to life-threatening complications, such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Public health campaigns should focus on increasing awareness about the silent progression of these diseases and the importance of regular check-ups.

### Strengthening Surveillance and Response
Improving surveillance systems to monitor emerging and re-emerging diseases is essential for containing potential outbreaks and reducing mortality rates. This includes enhancing the capacity to detect and respond to diseases like monkeypox and H7N9, which may not be widespread but can have severe public health implications. Strengthening the coordination between local and national health agencies, along with investment in more sophisticated diagnostic tools, will allow for quicker detection and response to these emerging threats.

Moreover, healthcare infrastructure must be bolstered to cope with the seasonal surges in cases of diseases like influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Hospitals should be prepared with sufficient resources, including medical personnel and antiviral medications, to handle the influx of cases. Telemedicine could also be leveraged to alleviate the burden on physical healthcare facilities, especially for non-emergency consultations.

### Social Behavior and Hygiene Education
To further reduce the spread of infectious diseases, there should be an increased emphasis on promoting better hygiene practices in the public, particularly in schools and daycare centers. Programs should be implemented to teach children about handwashing, the importance of sanitation, and how to minimize the spread of viruses, especially during peak seasons for diseases like influenza and hand-foot-and-mouth disease. Additionally, promoting social distancing during peak infectious disease periods and encouraging symptomatic individuals to seek medical care early will help reduce transmission.

In conclusion, while many diseases continue to pose challenges to public health in China, a coordinated approach to vaccination, surveillance, and hygiene education can help mitigate their spread and impact. Public health authorities must remain vigilant and responsive to both emerging and persistent infectious diseases to protect the health of the population.
